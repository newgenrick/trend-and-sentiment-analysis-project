Right now all traffic to internet is routed on ISP1 and works well.We need to achieve the following: - VLAN 10 and 20 traffic going to internet should utilize the ISP1.- VLAN 200 traffic going to internet should utilize the ISP2.

But this most recent post does have one very important suggestion. You need to test from a client connected in vlan 200. If you want to try to test from the switch then you would also need to configure ip local policy. When you configure policy routing on an interface then PBR acts on traffic arriving on that interface but would not act on traffic generated from the switch itself. HTH Rick',\n",

The 550 does not seem to support access-class for limiting management access.

I am not sure about the 3000 platform but in some Nexus models (5ks and 6ks), you also have to do the QOS policy globally which means it applies to the whole switch. Servers would have to be enabled to be doing this as well right? Basically if they were and the switches weren't would that possible be the cause of packet drops? Yes I have ping drops which should not be applicable. The other thing too, so the switches are in a VPC domain but I don't have any of the server ports configured with vpc/port-channel. No issues with any of them except for the two host IPs I speak of. Is it mandatory to configure member ports for anything or servers that are dual connected to a pair of switches in a VPC domain (e.g. port-channel 2, vpc x)? Perhaps this is part of the problem but why is it only happening to a certain group and not everything. I am thinking if I try and do it now while things are running on the servers I will break the connection?\n",

      "I would like to optimise our existing core to floor infrastructure: We have 4 floors altogether with rougly 4x 48 port switches per floor.Each floor has its only dedicated fibre link direct to the Core switch in our Data Centre (some 10Gb and some 1Gb uplinks - we are slowly upgrading to 10Gb uplinks throughout).The DC core switch is configured as a layer 3 switch and has all the vlan interfaces set with an IP address which is in fact the default gateway address assigned to PCs and Servers. For example - PCs are on VLAN 22, interface VLAN 22 is set as IP address 172.22.1.252/24 which is the PC configured gateway. And the Server VLAN 20 interface on the Core switch has IP address 172.16.1.252/24 representing the default GW of the Servers. In effect the Core switch is the Layer 3 switch Gatway.The VTP mode on the Core switch is set to SERVER.Each floor switch is a Layer 2 switch - for those capable of running Layer 3 they have been dumbed down to only be a Layer 2 switch (no IP routing).The uplink trunks allow VLAN 20 and 22 from Core to Floors.The floor switches VTP mode is TRANSPARENT.
