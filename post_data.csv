Cisco Catalyst 950040X Fans Included or not,I am trying to quote a Cisco Catalyst 950040XA switch for a customer and the datasheet is unclear as to whether or not I need to include 5 of the FANT4R modules I opened a PDI ticket and they said that the power supplies have fans built in and I can order the FANT4R modulesbut they didnt tell me if they are required or not Thanks in advance,See table15 in this link The chassis comes with 2 power supplies and build in fans httpswwwciscocomcenusproductscollateralswitchescatalyst9500seriesswitchesdatasheetc78738978html HTH So they fans that are built into the power supplies are sufficient to cool the system under normal operations correct Meaning I do not have to order the fan modules  they are completely optional The fans are builtin and come with the switch If you look at the picture in the link I posted the switch comes with 2 PSUs and 4 or 5 fan trays HTH

Connect VLANs from 2 switches via a router,Hi everyone as in the project attached I want the Network Administrator to communicate with all the computers I can just do it with the computers in Switch 1 I cant get Network Administrator to ping the computers in Switch 2right Could you please check and offer solution  Thank you,Hello this looks like a Packet Tracer project post the pkt file rename it to jpg first otherwise the system wont let you upload Thanks for the tip I attached it as jpg please change extension to pkt Thanks so much Hello you are using the same address space on two sides of the router 19216810 and 192168990 This doesnt work What is the requirement  The easiest way to resolve this is to connect one switch to the other as I have done in the project attached there has to be a router connecting 2 switches And all the vlans can communicate to each other The network administrator can ping all the computers Is the requirement to use the same address space on both switches  It doesnt say anything about that Just use trunking int vlan and encapsulation command Here is the instruction file Im stuck at the last question at page 6 add a router between the two switches to allow all vlans to communicate with each other Thanks so much for your help Hello just change the IP addresses of the computers connected to the switch on the right as I have done in the attached project file is there any way we can keep the addresses because the requirement is like the figure in page 7 You need to use bridging Could you please tell how to do that So we cant make the computers on the right switch connected just using concepts in the pdf file Thanks Hello are you supposed to accomplish this task in Packet Tracer  Packet Tracer has a very limited subset of commands it does not support bridging yes i have to use packet tracer But if there is no way to connect like this so maybe the right computers cant get connected to the network using this topology Because the question asks for what PC replies to Network Administrator

Switch voice and native VLAN configure switchports,HelloLets consider a switch with 24 switchports like Cisco Catalyst WSC2960L24TSLLSwitchport number 5 is connected to a wireless access point AP like Cisco AIRAP1832IEK9Frames arriving from the AP on the switch can have the VLAN tag 261 voice or 262 nativeSwitchport number 11 is connected to a CUBE ISROther switchports should only carry untagged traffic on native VLAN 262How to configure the switchportsOther switchportsHow should I configure themDo they need to know that native VLAN number is 262How to tell themThanks,Hello on the other ports you need to specify the native vlan but you do not need to explicitly allow it since the native vlan is always allowed implicitly If you want just the untagged traffic from Vlan 262 to pass the trunk the ports need to be configured as below config interface Gi 011configif switchport mode trunkconfigif switchport trunk native vlan 262configif switchport trunk allowed vlan none Hello Thank you Ill try that
Cat 6840X traffic shaping,Looking for some validation  assistance should the following be incorrect The goal is to implement egress traffic shaping on the 6840 platform while maintaining a priority queue for voice and ideally video data This hardware should support a 2P6Q4T structure and shaping is supported on the datasheet below config shows what I have used to try and achieve thathowever if i do an iperf test using UDP traffic at a rate greater than the shape rate say 125Mbit voice and video quality becomes very bad on the receiving end The priority traffic seems to be getting dropped when the interface is oversubscribed The other end of the call remains good quality The iperf client is on another port sending the traffic to the iperf server behind the shaped port Thus the traffic should be subject to the shaping policy As well there is a phone behind the port having a telepresence enabled call with another phone upstream The port the policy is applied to is a trunk port to a gigabit layer 2 switch DSCP trust is enabled on access ports and trunk port of that switch 6840 trusts DSCP by default Classmapsclassmap type lanqueuing matchall VOICE2P6Q4TPQ1 match dscp efclassmap type lanqueuing matchall VIDEO2P6Q4TPQ2 match dscp cs4 af41 af42 af43 cs5classmap type lanqueuing matchall TRANSDATA2P6Q4TQUEUE match dscp af21 af22 af23classmap type lanqueuing matchall SCAVENGER2P6Q4TQUEUE match dscp cs1 classmap type lanqueuing matchall BULKDATA2P6Q4TQUEUE match dscp af11 af12 af13classmap type lanqueuing matchall CONTROL2P6Q4TQUEUE match dscp cs2 cs3 cs6 cs7classmap type lanqueuing matchall MMSTREAM2P6Q4TQUEUE match dscp af31 af32 af33 Policymaps,
Help on configuration of PBR on Cisco 3850 Switch,Hello Community We have this network design Could you please help me how to configure PBR on our Cisco 3850 switchWe have VLANs 10 and 20 and added a Guest Wifi network on VLAN 200 Also we have two ISP and two firewalls Right now all traffic to internet is routed on ISP1 and works wellWe need to achieve the following  VLAN 10 and 20 traffic going to internet should utilize the ISP1 VLAN 200 traffic going to internet should utilize the ISP2 Thank you in advance Solved Go to Solution,Thanks for this information What version of code is this 3850 running In looking at the release notes it appears that the implementation of PBR for the 3850 is not full featured in comparison to IOS routers I wonder if it would make any difference if you remove the parameters for verifyavailability and for track from your route ma HTH Rick Hello provided you have at least IPBase installed on the switch the below should work accesslist 101 permit ip 19216810x

generate from the Switch are non policy routed you must test the PBR from the clients that use the SVI as GatewayRegards I do not agree with the suggestion that the original poster should have a default route for each ISP And I agree with the statement from Paul that you do not need two route maps Default routing for ISP 1 and PBR for ISP 2 should produce the desired results and having tracking and the verifyavailability are good improvements on the basic functionality But this most recent post does have one very important suggestion You need to test from a client connected in vlan 200 If you want to try to test from the switch then you would also need to configure ip local policy When you configure policy routing on an interface then PBR acts on traffic arriving on that interface but would not act on traffic generated from the switch itself HTH Rick Hi Richard Thank you for the additional information The PBR is not applying on int vlan 200 What i need to check
