Cisco Port Forwarding from 1841 to cisco switch,HelloIm trying to get port forwarding working for cacti to go through the wan port of the cisco 1841 to an internal switch My cacti server has access to the 1841 on udp 161 and that works I can monitor the 1841 statsHowever if I try to do cacti to the ip of the 1841 at a different port like udp 1246 and have that port forward to the ip of the switch on udp 161 it doesnt work Its like the firewall is not allowing 1246 snmp is running on the switch and sudo nmap sUp 1246 125125125125 ip address of the 1841 shows that 1246 is openfiltered which I think means the firewall is blocking it The access list says my cacti server is permittedI have this ruleip nat inside source static udp 101000246 161 interface FastEthernet00 1246but it doesnt seem to help Cacti still cant reach it when I tell cacti to use 1246Any help would be appreciated,Have you configured the WAN and LANinterfaces of the 1841 for ip nat outside and ip nat inside Do you have an ACL on your external interface or are you running a firewall that needs to allow this port Double check the order of entries that the new line really matches  Dont stop after youve improved your network Improve the world by lending money to the working pooror share a meal with a hungry child RVCE Hello just to be sure do you have any other NAT rules with the same source  Because if you do add the keyword extendable to each rule ip nat inside source static udp 101000246 161 interface FastEthernet00 1246 extendable
Multicast routing Question,ExpertsI have a basic doubt how multicast routing flows source to destination point of view I understand the various mode like sparsedense but I am not sure about above doubtany help is appriciatedThanks Solved Go to Solution,Multicast sources select a multicast IP to send to Multicast receivers select a multicast IP to receive from When multicast sources and receivers are using the same multicast IP multicast packets should if you have a multicast capable and enabled infrastructure flow from the sources to the receivers However a receivers multicast application generally also insures the multicast packets are those actually desired If they are not they are ignored Actual configuration of the multicast IP whether source or receiver is generally done within a multicast application RVCE Multicast sources select a multicast IP to send to Multicast receivers select a multicast IP to receive from When multicast sources and receivers are using the same multicast IP multicast packets should if you have a multicast capable and enabled infrastructure flow from the sources to the receivers However a receivers multicast application generally also insures the multicast packets are those actually desired If they are not they are ignored Actual configuration of the multicast IP whether source or receiver is generally done within a multicast application

Droppedforgotten routes  2921  iiNet NBN,Hi allAfter much searching I cant seem to find others with the same issues I am seeing Hopefully you can spare some time to suggest what could be the issueWe have a Australian NBN connection FTTP and a 2921 routerAccording to the isp the UniD port and the NTD check out fine The NTD is connected to our Gi02 portThe symptoms are in both directions outgoing to the internet and incoming from the internetThe problems show up like a time out but from the limited debugging skills I have in IOS I can see the timeouts related to entries that are not in the CEF FIB table Entries join the table about 90 seconds after the initial request Once in the table they connect fineipv6 cef is disabled only using ipv4The table appears to get up to about 16000 entriesI also tried this without CEF and saw the same symptom at least from an outgoing perspectiveDNS resolution is finesh versionCisco IOS Software C2900 Software C2900UNIVERSALK9M Version 1512T4 RELEASE

virtualreassembly in duplex auto speed auto no cdp enableIs there any way to tell the router to use the default gateway by default when it cant resolve via its internal FIB tableShould I be using a completely different routing methodCould this be a hardware problemCould this be an NBNisp issue that they just havent worked out yetI do use a small amount of static NAT rules and the router does have phone system components which are currently unusedThanks allLindsay,Lindsay the default memory for the 2921 is 512MB which should be plenty for 16000 FIB entries However it might be worth looking at CPU utilization when these timeouts occur The command sh proc cpu will show you the utilization and what processes are causing it You might want to add ip tcp adjustmss 1420 to your GigabitEthernet02 You have just one static route I assume  ip route 0000 0000 GigabitEthernet02  RVCE Thanks for the response Ill look into the adjustmss option There are a few static routes 5  the default that point back to the internal network I have a few subnets and until recently had two WAN links the second WAN link was hooked into an ADSL router The issues were present with both WAN links so the cuase is not a change based on that The default route is indeed ip route 0000 0000 Gi02 There are hosts on the same subnet as the router and an entry for this subnet routed via Gi02 not sure if this is needed however but doubt it would cause an issue ip route 10110 2552552550 Gi02 Ill monitor the processor usage also Thanks again RVCE Hello if possible can you post the full config of your router  Maybe there is something else in there that could be adjusted RVCE Thanks for that Ill post a sanitized config a bit later To continue on the debugging theme I assume ARP is resolved before CEFFIB tables When debugging I can see that it is taking about 90 seconds to create an ARP entry for new entries not already in the ARP table While this is not there no traffic parses into the debug data debug all was used to show this ping and traceroute are the typical test commands Once the ARP entry is created ping and traceroute and associated debug messages work as expected Ive tried this with cef enabled and disabled From a CPU perspective the router is not doing all that much and I have not yet seen any CPU spikes most processes under 05 from what Ive seen to date Is there a way to tell if ARP delays are to do with my router or the ISP end I also have a Cisco 3750g switch connected to this 2921 which CDP appears to correctly show I found the tcp adjustmss 1412 was more stable than 1420 With 1420 I appeared to get more regular drop outs remote connection from another location but it hasnt been all that long yet so still monitoring this piece also other research appears to show MTU  40 is an appropriate MSS setting Cheers again RVCE Hello I wonder if you create a static ARP entry for the next hop which is the NBN device  arp ip address macaddress arpa RVCE Hi again Im still struggling to find the most appropriate configuration to make this work properly To update weve been able to flatten the network considerably over the last few days have been planning to for a while this forced our hand We now have a single static route in the 2921 We have a 3750 providing DHCP to clients currently with the 2921 using an ip on the same subnet as the dhcp range I saw other details that say to use ip route 0000 0000 dhcp instead of point to an interface For us this didnt work effectively I did seem to help but clearly some traffic was not being routed effectively eg nothing getting the destination NATs in the router from the internet side I suspect DHCP being directly connected the 3750 was faster to respond than the ISP dhcp So at the moment we are still using Gi02 as the ip route but it is typically taking 90 seconds to resolve an ARP entry and create it in the 2921 arp table I also tried using ip route 0000 0000 gi02 dhcp but this did not seem to be any

appreciate your feedback on how I could possibly make the ip route dhcp preferred configuration work or other options Thanks kindly Linz RVCE Hello I have a question You wrote I did seem to help but clearly some traffic was not being routed effectively eg nothing getting the destination NATs in the router from the internet side Are you talking about traffic coming FROM the Internet TO your local network or traffic ORIGINATING on your local network going out TO the Internet  RVCE What I believe I saw  and this was only brief as this is in a production context hence minimising outage time  the traffic coming FROM the internet to NAT configured on the router pointing to service inside our network  stopped working completely  but due to the short time I could give this I guess I cant be 100 certain it wouldnt eventually find its way to our router Traffic going out improved by way of something like 1 in 2 packets getting to the correct destination  BUT  only when I had both of these in place ip route 0000 0000 gi02 ip route 0000 0000 dhcp surprisingly the router let me implement two routes for 0000 So from what I can deduce the dhcp based route did actually work for some of the time perhaps competing with the local dhcp in the 3750  but it still needed the gi02 route to work at all The ARP issue appeared to reduce not stop when both routes were in as new sites resolved for the most part not 100 however  perhaps the router was doing some sort of round robin process Thanks again if we can resolve this Ill owe you a beer or three RVCE Hello I would remove the static default route out of gi02 altogether and leave the dhcp one in there There are multiple problems with static default routes pointing to local Ethernet interfaces one of them being that the local ARP table gets very large because for every packet sent out the interface must ARP for the destination The reason you see an improvement with the dhcp default route added is that the router does load sharing using both default routes since CEF is enabled So try and remove ip route 0000 0000 gi02 and check if that makes a difference
Source NAT help needed Combining 2 router configurations,Hello Cisco Support Community Please reference the attached diagram and router configurations I need to combine the functionality of the PEL NAT router into the main PEL router so I can remove the NAT router Any guidance including specific configuration changes would be greatly appreciatedCurrent NAT functionality summaryNetwork hosts at ZNET and XNET sites send data over IPSec tunnels to specific 102546x addresses ip accesslist extended PARTNERDESTINED on the PEL router which are then routed to the PEL NAT router where they are translated to specific Partner site 17225200x addresses via ip nat outside source static Traffic is then routed back to the main PEL router and sent out the Partner tunnel ip accesslist extended PARTNERORIGINATED ZNET and XNET cannot see traffic to or from the Partner site subnet they only see the 102546x subnet Traffic between the ZNETXNET sites and the Office site is not translated There is a different set of hosts at ZNETXNET sites that send traffic to a server directly connected to the PEL routerConditionsNetwork hosts at ZNETXNET cannot show traffic to or from the Partner subnet 17225200024 Network hosts at XNETZNET cannot change their traffic destination address 102546x and the Partner IP addresses 17225200x they are mapped to can’t change either The Partner router cannot have an IPSec tunnel directly to ZNET or XNET sites or change the Partner router configuration Ideally all changes needed to combine the 2 PEL routers needs to be done in the main PEL router I tried removing the routemap NATPARTNER on the main PEL router and added ip nat inside source static example ip nat inside source static 1722520076 10254646 to get traffic routing from ZNETXNET to Partner but this wont hide the Partner destinationsource subnet Again any guidance or help to combine these 2 routers into 1 would be appreciated,Hello it looks like basically all your PELNATROUTER is doing is NAT It should be possible to achieve that in the PELROUTER I am currently labbing thismight take a while Ill be back with a proposed config RVCE Hello I labbed your setup in GNS3 and here is what I have come up with so far To move all static NAT entries from PELNATROUTER to PELROUTER configure the static route on the PELROUTER PELROUTERconfigip route 172252000 2552552550 GigabitEthernet00 Then add static NAT entries on PELROUTER ip nat outside source static 1722520070 10254642 addrouteip nat outside source static 1722520071 10254643 addrouteip nat outside source static 1722520072 10254641 addrouteip nat outside source static 1722520073 10254644 addrouteip nat outside source static 1722520074 10254645 addrouteip nat outside source static 1722520076 10254646 addrouteip nat outside source static 1722520083 10254640 addrouteip nat outside source static 17225200230 10254634 addrouteip nat outside source static 17225200231 10254637 addrouteip nat outside source static 17225200235 10254635 addrouteip nat outside source static 17225200236 10254636 addrouteip nat outside source static 17225200237 10254638 addrouteip nat outside source static 17225200245 10254632 addrouteip nat outside source static 17225200250 10254633 addrouteip nat outside source static 17225200252 10254639 addroute Question what is the purpose of the secondary IP address on interface GigabitEthernet02 on PELROUTER  The interface doesnt do any NAT and it seems that it is only used as the next hop for the static route for network 172252000 coming from PELNATROUTER  RVCE Hi The purpose of the secondary IP on G02 is just as you interpreted It is the next hop for the static route for network 172252000 coming from PELNATROUTER Will we will still need to figure out how the route map NATPARTNER and the 2 ACLs for PARTNERORIGINATED and PARTNERDESTINED will need to be adjusted RVCE Hello I tried the configuration adjustments above but it still would not NAT correctly I removed the routemap NATPARTNER from G00 added the ip nat outside source static lines and the ip route 172252000 When I run a ping from a XNET PC 1017010 to 10254646 the main PEL router responds instead of routing the traffic to the matching Partner endpoint 1722520076 If I remove for example ip nat outside source static 1722520076 10254646 addroute and replace it with ip nat inside source static 1722520076 10254646 ip nat inside wont allow addroute and then run a ping from XNET PC 1017010 to 10254646 the Partner PC 1722520076 receives the icmp packet and replies but the XNET PC never receives the reply from packet captures on both ends Also when I ping from the Partner PC 1722520076 to XNET PC 1017010 the XNET PC never recieves the echo request Did I do something wrong and if not does anyone have any input on what I can try next

What is relation among flash bootflash and harddisk in Cisco router ,Hi Any one can explain what is relation among flash bootflash and harddisk in Cisco router especially in ASR1000 or other device Thank you,Hi Most Cisco devices dont have hard disks they only have flash where the IOS and other boot file reside The flash size varies from megabytes to multi gigabytes Other vendors devices like Juniper have both flash and hard disks They use flash for booting the device and the hard disk for storing log files since they usually come in larger size30gig 60gig etc HTH RVCE Thank you so much for your reply So we can think they all are storage room and the different thing among them is different size right

EIGRP  Hello packets,I was doing some sniffing of my network and noticed that my EIGRP hello packets are being sentseen to all my internal switches How can i stop this Do I just make the internal vlans a passive interface or is there another way,Making the interfaces passive is probably the cleanest and easiest way to accomplish this Depending on your environment you may want to look at using the passiveinterface default option So if you have many interfaces and just a few that need actual peering it will make things a lot easier

Cisco IOS Limit WAN Download Bandwith,Hi allWe have 3Mbps Internet link connected to Cisco Router The router has GRE tunnel to remote site Most of the time Internet usage hit maximum causes my VPN performance drop even though actual VPN traffic is less than 100Kbps Because the maximum usage of VPN only 100kbps the balance bandwidth was utilized by Internet traffic which is about 29Mbpsstill considered congestion at 97 Due to this overall link performance drop and eventually effect VPN performance as well So to overcome this we planned to limit Internet usage to 25Mbps on download direction  so that no congestion happens  But im unable to achieve this with CBQOSBelow is my command under classdefault police rate 2500000 conformaction transmit exceedaction dropI could see the drop rate at 500Kbps conform rate at 25Mbps I have applied the same policy on WAN interface Input direction and LAN interface Output direction But still the WAN interface download usage stays at 3Mbps LAN interface output rate shows at 25Mbps as expected WHY IS THIS SO  Solved Go to Solution,Hi policing or shaping this way is not a best practice because you drop packets after they traverse the bottleneck your WAN Link Dropping after the link cant directly avoid congestion because congestion happen before your router Depending on the type of traffic you could have some indirect effect because TCP sessions should reduce their window but the real effect its hard to foreseen and moreover you could have also UDP traffic the effect of packet dropping for this kind of traffic depends primarily on the application generating the traffic flow Consider also that in case of DoS attack dropping traffic in this way has no effect Bye enrico PS please rate if useful RVCE Hi policing or shaping this way is not a best practice because you drop packets after they traverse the bottleneck your WAN Link Dropping after the link cant directly avoid congestion because congestion happen before your router Depending on the type of traffic you could have some indirect effect because TCP sessions should reduce their window but the real effect its hard to foreseen and moreover you could have also UDP traffic the effect of packet dropping for this kind of traffic depends primarily on the application generating the traffic flow Consider also that in case of DoS attack dropping traffic in this way has no effect Bye enrico PS please rate if useful RVCE Disclaimer The Author of this posting offers the information contained within this posting without consideration and with the readers understanding that theres no implied or expressed suitability or fitness for any purpose Information provided is for informational purposes only and should not be construed as rendering professional advice of any kind Usage of this postings information is solely at readers own risk Liability Disclaimer In no event shall Author be liable for any damages wha2tsoever including without limitation damages for loss of use data or profit arising out of the use or inability to use the postings information even if Author has been advised of the possibility of such damage Posting To expand a bit on what eciollaro has posted managing inbound traffic bandwidth consumption is a bit hit or miss If its mostly TCP traffic policing much much lower often insures theres sufficient traffic for your other traffic Ie try policing Internet ingress at 1 Mbps and adjust Also if most traffic is TCP you can shape return ACKs but this tends to be inexact too You can also investigate obtaining a dedicated traffic shaping appliance that has other tricks like spoofing TCP RWINs but they too wont always work for the reasons noted in eciollaros post Your best option is to obtain another Internet link dedicated for VPN traffic only and hope no one performs a DoS attack against it RVCE Thanks We are getting dedicated bandwidth management device to achieve the requirement  Thanks again Regards Nagis

ASR1002 with BGP 3 ISP weird issue,Last week We had a strange occurrence at work We have 3 ISPs that are all doing BGP to advertise our prefixes Tuesday Morning at 604 our biggest connection went down Good thing was the others took over This is where things went weird Contacted ATT referencing the auto generated ticket from them After 4 days they replace a bunch of bright jacks Fancy ATT stuff to help them monitor light Various SFPs XFPs and cross connects Or so Im told The connection was still down When i was on my router which is running Cisco IOS XE Software Version 031603S  Extended Support Release Cisco IOS Software ASR1000 Software PPCLINUXIOSDADVENTERPRISEK9M Version 1553S3 RELEASE SOFTWARE fc1 I couldnt ping the interface on my other end When I checked ARP for the IPs my side was listed correctly but the other end showed incomplete They stated they could see mine Finally we decided to reboot our router and when the router came back up it saw the mac address on the other end and brought the connection back upThis to me doesnt add up I reseated the XFP reseated the 10GB SPA card that had the connection We even tried other XFPs but the connection wouldnt go up I dont have any logs To me this sounds like a strange bug but I dont know what ATT did on the other end yet Has anyone seen this before The connection that went down was running for 2 months prior to going down The connection is also configured to be doing primary and secondary encapsulation Q on Q which I had never seen before,Ryan weird indeed When you rebooted the router you automatically cleared the ARP cache I am thinking if they changed hardware the corresponding MAC addresses might have changed too Default ARP timeout is I think is 1500 seconds RVCE During the outage I did clear the arp but that didnt seem to help

Encrypting Transient Traffic,I have three locations connected via leased lines One location feeds the other two to the internet That location is also where our DMZs live In a year or so well be getting an internet connection to one of the other locations In the event that our primary location isp goes down and traffic from the outside destined to our DMZ reroutes through the secondary location over our internal wan and on to the DMZ at the primary location Should this outside traffic be encrypted as it passes through our internal network,You certainly want to keep the external traffic separated from your internal traffic if it is arriving at the secondary location and being sent to the dmz at the primary location But I do not see that encrypting the traffic would help accomplish any separation We typically encrypt our traffic if it will pass through networks that are not secure so that no one can read our traffic In the situation that you describe it is unsecure traffic passing through your network Encrypting it would make it difficult for you to read it But why would you attempt to read it HTH Rick

BGP removeprivateas vs removeprivateas all,Im using the BGP option removeprivateas to strip out our private AS numbers for routes sent via the WAN This works well However some paths are from Amazon VPCs end with their ASNs usually 7224 or 9059 In this case the advertised route still ends up looking like thisI was hoping the command removeprivateas all would change this path to 1234 1234 7224 but reading thru the document its not clear to me what exactly this does Solved Go to Solution,Hello prior to IOS 1512T the removeprivateas feature had the following restriction If the AS path included both private and public AS numbers using the neighbor removeprivateas command would not remove the private AS numbers That is why the optional keyword all was added which should remove private AS numbers even when there are public AS numbers in the path RVCE Not sure what your config looks like but the private AS numbers are only removed if your AS is public If it is not you need to configure neighbor xxxx localas 200 or anything else in the public AS domain RVCE The AS on the last hop router is public 1234 Private ASes are stripped out if the path is entirely private So a path like this 65441 65442 65443 Gets changed to this 1234 But if I already have 1234 in the path it doesnt fully work RVCE Hello prior to IOS 1512T the removeprivateas feature had the following restriction If the AS path included both private and public AS numbers using the neighbor removeprivateas command would not remove the private AS numbers That is why the optional keyword all was added which should remove private AS numbers even when there are public AS numbers in the path RVCE removeprivateas all is what I wanted The documentation wasnt very clear on what the all vs all inheritas options did I wrote a blog post with some path examples

Gig switch port not working set 100full,I do many internet turn ups and one of the providers I work with always hands off the internet hardcoded to 100 full duplex If I have to patch it through a gig switch it comes up 100 half duplex on the switch side If I hard code the speed or duplex at all the interface does not come up If I call and have the provider and have them set their side Auto then both come up fine 1000full For the most part this has come up on 2960xs or 3750 switches The product the provider is using is ADVA FSP150CCF Does anyone have a setting for the switch that would allow me to hard code the interface and have it work Solved Go to Solution,No Its better to leave it autoauto RVCE I never found a solution and now that I know what to expect I ask ahead of time to have it set that way So almost 50 time now the provider has it autoauto For me it was a ADVA as well and the provider is Time Warner RVCE No Its better to leave it autoauto RVCE I know but that means I need to spend an hour on the phone with the provider on almost every install I was hoping someone had a way where I could skip that step RVCE leave to autoauto and policeshape traffic at 100 Mbps RVCE The real issue is it come up Half duplex and I get a fraction of the performance I am supposed to because the provider side is set to full RVCE Apologies for resurrecting a very old thread but I was wondering if you managed to get an answer to this question I have a service provider handing over their connection at 100Mbps Full Duplex via their ADVA Fibre Optic Carrier Ethernet Switch which we have no control of When we hook up an RJ45 between it and our Cisco router the Cisco interface auto negotiates at 100Mbit Half Duplex I understand this is because we have one side service provider side hard coded But the weird part is IF we set the Cisco Interface to 100 Full the link goes down If I set to Full Auto it goes back to 100 Half I know the simple answer is to have the service provider set their side to AUTOAUTO but what could I do to get the link up without having to contact the provider each time The provider requires a new order to be raised to change these settings and it takes a day if not longer to generate these orders Thanks RVCE But the weird part is IF we set the Cisco Interface to 100 Full the link goes down If I set to Full Auto it goes back to 100 Half If your router is set at AutoAuto then MDIMDIX is enabled If hardcoded then MDIMDIX is disabled So the next question is Is the cable used to connect the router a crossover cable or straightthrough RVCE So I have exploring this option and the cable is a straight through and I am beginning to wonder if it should be a cross over The cable we have been using is a straight through Curiously is the rule of thumb to use a cross over when hard coding I understand you normally would use a cross over when its router to router but if a straightthrough was used MDIMDIX would take care of that by detecting the cable and adjusting the settings on the interface however your comment states that this would only occur if both sides were set to autonegotiate Is MDIMDIX disabled when hardcoding one side or both And if it is disabled is a cross over needed For my own knowledge purposes  can using the wrong cable make the link default to 100 HALF irrespective of speedduplex settings We have also connected our laptop directly to the carrier ethernet switch aka ADVA unit The NIC has been hardcoded 100MB FULL Its difficult to see in Windows what the hell is going but I suspect there is a duplex issue because a speed test produces 100MB down and 32  7mbpsmb UP If we set the laptop to autoauto same results Theres sadly no tool in Windows to see what the system negotiates at when set to Auto For the record  2 days and still cannot get the provider to get me an answer RVCE Curiously is the rule of thumb to use a cross over when hard coding The ruleofthumb is to enable autoauto so MDIMDIX is enabled For my own knowledge purposes  can using the wrong cable make the link default to 100 HALF irrespective of speedduplex settings Wrong cable no If your router is talking to providers router then it should be a crossover cable 2 days and still cannot get the provider to get me an answer The provider is not entitled to give an answer since theyve been collecting your money RVCE So when is MDIMDIX disabled When one side is set hardcoded or both RVCE So when is MDIMDIX disabled When one side is set hardcoded or both If the provider wants to disable MDIMDIX then they hard code speed and duplex If YOU want to disable MDIMDIX then YOU need to hard code speed and duplex RVCE Apologies for the repeat So in our scenario we are using a straight through cable The provider has hard coded their speed and duplex to 100 Full When we have our side set to autoauto the link is auto negotiated at 100 HALF When we set to 100 Full on our side the link goes down Are we likely to establish the link if a cross over was used instead RVCE So in our scenario we are using a straight through cable Fact 1 When we set to 100 Full on our side the link goes down Fact 2 Are we likely to establish the link if a cross over was used instead Correct Use a crossover cable and the link should recover RVCE I never found a solution and now that I know what to expect I ask ahead of time to have it set that way So almost 50 time now the provider has it autoauto For me it was a ADVA as well and the provider is Time Warner RVCE Hi there Auto negotiation has come a long way in the 15 years or so and it is very stabledependable I 100 understand that providers 50 of them based on your experience still live in the past and hard code the settings Anytime the operator chooses to manually configure they need to take responsibility for their configuration In todays complex world it is not easy This is the main reason why manual config fails to work very often because the provider contacthelpdesk is not the same person who is physically onsite This is also the reason why autonegotiation is a better elegantcleaner way to go Props to you to change your work schedule and engage the provider to configure

Understanding IP mroute table,Hi AllI was doing a multicast lab to understand more about multicast routing I have sparsedensemode running on all the interfacesThis is the routing table from one of the devices Unlike the unicast routing table this mroute table is bit more tough to understandR6sh ip mrouteIP Multicast Routing TableFlags D  Dense S  Sparse B  Bidir Group s  SSM Group C  Connected L  Local P  Pruned R  RPbit set F  Register flag T  SPTbit set J  Join SPT M  MSDP created entry E  Extranet X  Proxy Join Timer Running A  Candidate for MSDP Advertisement U  URD I  Received Source Specific Host Report Z  Multicast Tunnel z  MDTdata group sender Y  Joined MDTdata group y  Sending to MDTdata group G  Received BGP CMroute g  Sent BGP CMroute Q  Received BGP SA Route q  Sent BGP SA Route V  RD  Vector v  VectorOutgoing interface flags H  Hardware switched A  Assert winner Timers UptimeExpires Interface state Interface NextHop or VCD StateMode 239111 000035stopped RP 6666 flags SJC Incoming interface Null RPF nbr 0000 Outgoing interface list FastEthernet10 ForwardSparseDense 00003500024016111 239111 000035000224 flags T Incoming interface FastEthernet00 RPF nbr 16111 Outgoing interface list FastEthernet10 ForwardSparseDense 000035000240 239112 000020stopped RP 0000 flags DC Incoming interface Null RPF nbr 0000 Outgoing interface list FastEthernet00 ForwardSparseDense 000020stopped FastEthernet10 ForwardSparseDense 000020stopped16111 239112 000013000246 flags T Incoming interface FastEthernet00 RPF nbr 16111 Outgoing interface list FastEthernet10 ForwardSparseDense 000013stopped 2240140 000036000259 RP 0000 flags DCL Incoming interface Null RPF nbr 0000 Outgoing interface list FastEthernet00 ForwardSparseDense 000036stopped FastEthernet10 ForwardSparseDense 000036stoppedR6The multicast IP 239111 is routed in sparse mode with a manual RP  239112 is getting routed in dense modeCan anyone please tell me why the route table is showing  239111 AND  239112 What is the meaning of that Also what is the time counter in the routing tableCF,Hello the timers in the table refer to the uptimeexpiration time of the mroutes The G entries represent the shared trees for your multicast groups 239111 and 239112 The concept is a bit tedious to expain in short have a look at this link httpwwwciscopresscomarticlesarticleaspp32100 Also here is an explanation of the various output fields of sh ip mroutemight be helpful as well httpdtdccieblogspotnl201503showipmroutefielddescriptionshtml
Cisco Router for 400down20up NAT throughput,Hi allI know yet another throughput question But it is acutally not too easy to get these numbers and to pick a suitable routerI recently ordered a brand new 400Mbps down  20Mbps up cable connection with static IP So I connected my 1941 to that cable modem which is actually a router but not really acting as such through GigEthernet and simply configured the static IP a default route and NAT With NAT enabled the 1941 is maxing out at 210Mbps down When connecting my PC to the cable box directly I get the full lovely speed of 433Mbps It looks like the 1941 is bottlenecking me hereIs there any chance for a not totally overkill super expensive Cisco Router that could handle my scenario I was looking at a 2951 at best Everything above would unfortunately be out of my ballparkI would appreciate any suggestions or helpCheersFelix,Hi a 2951 wont give you 400  you would need a 3900 series minimum or higher  best scenario with 2951 you will get a couple of hundred mb  they say closer to 300 but thats not real world you have to take into consideration all the other features in use in the router RVCE I did some research on the web before I started this thread and indeed was quite sceptical that a 2951 could handle the bandwidth Somehow I was hoping it would do it at least with NAT only and without any additonal services enabled But even if it would do 400 with NAT where is the benefit if I cant use other features in the future meeeh Im sad Thanks for your quick feedback though RVCE Disclaimer The Author of this posting offers the information contained within this posting without consideration and with the readers understanding that theres no implied or expressed suitability or fitness for any purpose Information provided is for informational purposes only and should not be construed as rendering professional advice of any kind Usage of this postings information is solely at readers own risk Liability Disclaimer In no event shall Author be liable for any damages wha2tsoever including without limitation damages for loss of use data or profit arising out of the use or inability to use the postings information even if Author has been advised of the possibility of such damage Posting Just saw this post after posting my other post For NAT performance alone see table 6 in the reference I provided RVCE Thanks very much for your input The 210mbps on a 1941 is actually the reason why I am still digging deeper into this Because like you said it might be possible that I can squeeze more out of these Routers due to my light traffic mix But 3900 is simply too expensive Maybe I get the chance to test a 2951 and see how far I get with it RVCE Actual traffic is a huge variable to an ISRs performance Table 1 shows performance for both minimum and standard maximum size packets Unfortunately they show the former in Kpps and the latter in Mbps but the formula for minimal size is 1448 Mpps is needed for 1 Gbps RVCE Disclaimer The Author of this posting offers the information contained within this posting without consideration and with the readers understanding that theres no implied or expressed suitability or fitness for any purpose Information provided is for informational purposes only and should not be construed as rendering professional advice of any kind Usage of this postings information is solely at readers own risk Liability Disclaimer In no event shall Author be liable for any damages wha2tsoever including without limitation damages for loss of use data or profit arising out of the use or inability to use the postings information even if Author has been advised of the possibility of such damage Posting For 420 Mpbs of aggregated bandwidth Cisco would recommend a 4K ISR as even the 3945E is recommended only for 350 Mpbs Might you go smaller Sure although youre more likely to run out of router performance However if you were able to hit 210 Mbps on your 1941 which Cisco recommends only for 25 Mbps of WAN ie duplex bandwidth shows your current traffic mix and router configuration may not require a good a router as Cisco recommends Its difficult to recommend what you need You might benefit from reviewing httpssupportforumsciscocomsitesdefaultfilesattachmentsdiscussionwhitepaperc1159548517pdf RVCE Can you post your config I have a 2951 with a 11010 connection and I can only squeeze 4510 out of it Im very interested in what I can do to get better speeds through the 2951 All Im running on the router is NAT and during speed tests I only see about 12 CPU usage so I know there is plenty of room for improvement I also get my ISP advertised speeds when connecting a PC directly to the modem
Config Help,Hello allI have a question and I am hoping you can answer it for meI have a situation where I am going to have a isr 1941 connected to an ASA 5508The public IP for the outside interface of the router and the ASA need to be on the same 29 This will mean my connection will have to pass through my inside interface of the Router I know it can be done I just cant find the right article to show me examplesAlso I need a good article that can show me how to pass traffic from the ASA to the Router if my router will be at the border and the ASA is behind it,Gregory can you post a brief topology map indicating how your router and the ASA are connected and which interface on the router needs access to what the Internet  RVCE Topology is as follows Internet 1849018012929    Router outside int 1809018013429 inside int this is where i need help     ASA Outside int 1809018013029 inside int 101010124 RVCE Sorry again for the confusion but how is your ASA connected to the router  You would obviously only need a public IP address on the ASA outside interface if it were connected to the Internet RVCE This is why I need the help For the time being the outside interface of the ASA has to keep the public ip for VPN purposes We are transitioning to Azure and are trying to cutover but the meshed network that is using the ASA as its VPN needs to stay up until the end we should be able to pass the traffic through RVCE Hello I also found this older article on how to add a secondary IP address to an outside interface of an ASA Have a look and give it a try httpwwwduceacom20080531addingasecondaryipaddressonaciscoasaethernetinterface RVCE On the ASA the global config command arp permitnonconnected allows for ARP requests and ARP responses from ARP packets that are not on the same subnet as the connected interface I am not sure how this would work in your case but assuming that the inside interface of your router is configured with an IP address enable the arp permitnonconnected feature on the ASA and check if you can reach the network on the inside of the router obviously dont forget to add the default route on the ASA pointing to the IP address of the inside interface of the router since that is your next hop
Policy Base Routing PBR Questions,Hi all Hope everyone is well I have dual routers  dual WAN links at the data center and at all remote locations please see attached diagram for topology overview Ive got PBR configured and working as design but I have a couple scenarios that I need some help with I have PBR configured on the Nexus 7K to route some applications over to the Verizon link and whats happening is see belowScenario 1 When the Verizon link at the data center goes down EIGRP reconverge and traffic automatically get rerouted over to the Sprint link Is there a way for me to NOT let traffic reroute over to the Sprint link  I would like to blackhole the traffic when Verizon link is down Scenario 2 When the Verizon link at the remote link site goes down traffic get blackhole and goes nowhere Is there a way to tell PBR to NOT route traffic over to the Verizon link at the data center when the Verizon link at the remote site is down  Thanks in advance Danny Solved Go to Solution,Hello you could use SLA tracking and route all traffic to null if one link is down For scenario 1 it would look like this IP addresses obviously need to be changed to what you have configured track 1 ip sla 1 reachibilityip sla 1 icmpecho xxxx sourceinterface FastEthernet01 timeout 1000 threshold 100 frequency 5ip sla schedule 1 life forever starttime nowip accesslist standard LANTRAFFIC permit 19216810 000255routemap DENYSPRINT permit 10 match ip address LANTRAFFIC set ip nexthop verifyavailability xxxx track 1 set interface null0Apply the policy to the interface connected to the Verizon link For scenario 2 you could track icmp reachability for the Verizon link at the remote site I hope I understood correctly where your links are but the idea of sla tracking is that in case a link is not reachable the route map is applied and with this route map all traffic gets blackholed RVCE Danny a floating static route would work as long as the primary route is dynamic which in your case it is since you use EIGRP Good solution actually You need one SLA for each remote siteIf you use only one for all remote sites the PING to all sites must fail simultaneously for anything to happen which does not seem to be what you want RVCE Hello you could use SLA tracking and route all traffic to null if one link is down For scenario 1 it would look like this IP addresses obviously need to be changed to what you have configured track 1 ip sla 1 reachibilityip sla 1 icmpecho xxxx sourceinterface FastEthernet01 timeout 1000 threshold 100 frequency 5ip sla schedule 1 life forever starttime nowip accesslist standard LANTRAFFIC permit 19216810 000255routemap DENYSPRINT permit 10 match ip address LANTRAFFIC set ip nexthop verifyavailability xxxx track 1 set interface null0Apply the policy to the interface connected to the Verizon link For scenario 2 you could track icmp reachability for the Verizon link at the remote site I hope I understood correctly where your links are but the idea of sla tracking is that in case a link is not reachable the route map is applied and with this route map all traffic gets blackholed RVCE Hi GPauwen thanks for replying  As for scenario 1 What do you think of the idea of using a floating static route pointing to null 0 interface to blackhole the traffic  and as for scenario 2 Do I configure one IP SLA operation for all remote sites  Do I configure one IP SLA operation per remote site  please see example below ip sla 1 icmpecho 1521771611 sourceinterface loopback0  location 1 icmpecho 1992200245 sourceinterface loopback0  location 2 or ip sla 1 icmpecho 1521771611 sourceinterface loopback0  location 1 ip sla 2 icmpecho 1992200245 sourceinterface loopback0  location 2 Thanks  Danny RVCE Danny a floating static route would work as long as the primary route is dynamic which in your case it is since you use EIGRP Good solution actually You need one SLA for each remote siteIf you use only one for all remote sites the PING to all sites must fail simultaneously for anything to happen which does not seem to be what you want RVCE Thanks GPauwen  So if I have to do one SLA for each remote site that means I have to create a routemap for each remote site too  I have over 20 remote sites and I am just trying to simplify the config Thanks  Danny RVCE Danny your route maps track the availability of specific next hops which are different for each remote site so yes you need 20 route maps Makes the configuration rather long but shouldnt be a problem for the router to handlesince the only traffic that it actually causes is ICMP RVCE Bummer I was hoping I can do one SLA and one routemap for all locations Thanks GPauwen

Differnet QoS configs and their outputs,HiI have 2 routers with 2 different QoS configson the first router the classmap CENTURYLINKP4 is defined but not used in the PRIORITIZE policymapon the second router the classmap CENTURYLINKP4 is defined and used in the PRIORITIZE policymapOn the the first router the show policymap interface output of the Classmap classdefault is showing drops which I believe is somewhat normal as this is dropping scavenger 0 1 traffic first when there is contentionOn the second router the show policymap interface output of the Classmap CENTURYLINKP4 is showing drops and the Classmap classdefault is not showing any dropsalthough it looks like a couple of packets have been getting throughIs the second router recognizing that there are 2 classmaps with the same IPP mapping and using the CENTURYLINKP4 first as it is listed in the PRIORITIZE policymapCould this be causing any issuesWhat is the better configThank youFirst router configclassmap matchany

platform and IOS version Do these links on a cloud that supports any QoS RVCE The first router is a 2911K9 running 1524M6a The second router is a ISR4331K9 running 1552S The routers connect to an MPLS cloud provider We have opted for the 4 Queues 20202040 method We were told we should match those percentages when creating our queues Not sure if that answers your questions Thank you RVCE Not sure if that answers your questions It helps Is the second router recognizing that there are 2 classmaps with the same IPP mapping and using the CENTURYLINKP4 first as it is listed in the PRIORITIZE policymap Could this be causing any issues What is the better config First understand different routers often have different traffic flows so comparing one to another could be like comparing apples to oranges Conversely maybe not too I could also say your different policy configurations might be causing issues but they might not too Sorry but not knowing your traffic or your QoS policy objectives cannot say whether another policy would be better I will say your routers with their IOS versions are about as good as it gets with Cisco equipment That said your default queue limits might be too small for the BDP We were told we should match those percentages when creating our queues Yes thats not uncommon but you dont always have to do that You could have a more elaborate QoS policy on your egress to MPLS while still taking advantage of the MPLS QoS policy Depending on your QoS objectives you might not have an optimal MPLS QoS policy too If you only had two routers running across a MPLS cloud you likely would be better served by not having any MPLS QoS If you have more than two routers and multipoint traffic flows then MPLS QoS is very helpful If you have more than two routers but your data flows are hubandspoke again MPLS QoS might not be beneficial In general I recommend a policy like policymap Sampleclass LLQ priority percent 33class foreground bandwidth remaining percent 81 fairqueueclass background bandwidth remaining percent 1 fairqueueclass classdefault bandwidth remaining percent 9 fairqueue In usage foreground and background classes should almost be inverse of their bandwidth allocations Additionally most traffic should be in classdefault unless theres a need to treat the traffic differently The secret to the above policy is FQ which generally keeps a few heavy usage flows from being adverse to other light usage flows FQ also tends to drops packets from heavy usage flows first RVCE Thanks for your response  I think I need to hit the books on QoSstarted reading the new End to End Qos book QoS is tricky and seems counterintuitive So are you saying it is OK to not match the percentages that our provider has allocated for the 4 queues  20202040 In your example class LLQ is for priority IPP 5 the class foreground is for IPP 4 6 7 and so on Why such a high percentage for Foreground Thank you RVCE QoS is tricky and seems counterintuitive It often seems that way but I think that has a lot to do with the way its generally taughtexplained So are you saying it is OK to not match the percentages that our provider has allocated for the 4 queues  20202040 Yes although I had more in mind more elaborate QoS For example your actual egress policy could have multiple classes that logically subdivide a MPLS class although generally the sum of those classes bandwidth would equal the MPLS class bandwidth In your example class LLQ is for priority IPP 5 the class foreground is for IPP 4 6 7 and so on Correct Why such a high percentage for Foreground Because I find QoS is often simpler to deal with if you think of dequeuing ratios rather that bandwidth reservations The purpose of Foregrounds high bandwidth percentage is to insure its almost treated like LLQ relative to class default Or to think of it like the old router PQ except it wont totally starve lower classes of bandwidth Likewise classdefault is almost treated like LLQ relative to the Background class
Dynamic Routing over Nexus 7K VPC ,Hi ExpertsI have the attached topology the 2 distribution switches are configured for VSS and I need to configure VPC between N7Ks and distribution switches so all four links are bundled together is it possible to do thisis it possible to run OSFP over VPC in my case because I have some routes on the distribution switch and I need to advertise themplease advisethanksHaitham Jneid,Hi Haitham Actually you can install one transit switch and connect all 4 switches to that transit switch instead of connecting all 4 switches together then create one transit vlan 192168100 and configure each switch into that ip like nexus 1  1921681010 nexus 2  1921681011 68001 1921681020 68002 1921681021 transitswitch  1921681025 now run ospf across 4 switches and one transit switch For distribution switches add a command into ospf config redistribute connected subnets so all your connected routesinterfaces will be advertised from dist switches hope this helps Thanks RVCE Hello With VPC and VSS you may configure the bundle Routng over VPC on Nx 7K is available with a feature called  Layer 3 over vPC for F2E and F3 Modules that is available for the specific hardware starting from 720D11 release RVCE It is good to know that routing over VPC is now available on N7K in some limited fashion So  5 for you It used to be that it was not possible at all Now for certain hardware and software versions there is some functionality It is a bit surprising that routing over VPC has not been supported on N7K but was supported on N5K HTH Rick
Wireless LAN Controller Issues,I have a Cisco vWLC I have a Public SSID which is working on one of my site but on another site when users try to connect it sits in a state of DHCPREQD rather than RUNDoes anyone know of any other issues like this with a possible fix I am using a server as my DHCP not the vWLC I know this is working fine because one of my sites are getting DHCP Could this issue be something to do with the AP GroupsThanks,hi i suggest moving this post on the wireless forum section to get more replies maybe the fast SSID change is disabled enable this feature by going to Controller  Fast SSID Change  Enabled  Apply  Save or in CLI config network fastssidchange enable RVCE Thanks John we managed to get this sorted The inteface for the AP was set as management and not the one we configured All working now RVCE Thanks for posting back to the forum and letting us know that you have managed to sort it out Your description of what turned out to be the problem may be helpful to other readers In the forum who might face a similar problem HTH Rick
