what would cause iptcpudp  checksum error,our Linux Server kernel log report lot of udp bad checksum now i am not sure if that means the udp packet was drop by the kerneland i am wondering what knid of think would cause the checksum error in data in transfering stage ,would RouterSwitch change iptcpudp checksum values  RVCE It shouldnt for higher level of the stack ie L3 andor L4 RVCE Sun spots Generally bad checksums or CRCs will cause whatever the base data being checked to be considered corrupt and ignoredActually there are many things that can corrupt a data transmission If fact at best transmission media generally has an expected error rate often its a very smalllow valueConversely if the error rate is higher especially if significantly higher than what the specs call for if should be investigated for remediationMore information might be found here httpsenwikipediaorgwikiBiterrorrate RVCE can RouterSwtich cause the data corrupt  RVCE Yes and noThe innards of the RouterSwitch usually notThe interfaces of the RouterSwitch it may RVCE or  how can we test the bit error rate  RVCE With a device design for such testingHowever within Cisco devices interface stats will often reveal media corruption errors
Spanning tree MST,Is Revision number and Region name is mandatory to configure without this whether MST will work or not as per my understanding both needs to identify which its belongs to MST configuration thanks vinoth Kumar C Solved Go to Solution,HiRegion is configured to prevent a misconfiguration imagine 2 o more switches configured with the same instance but the instances have different vlan groups so the region will be used to identify which vlan groups belong to the each instance Note it should never happen it should be a misconfiguration The switches on the same region must run the same MST ParametersWithin a region all the switches must run instance of MST that includes  MST Configuration name Revision number 0 to 65535 Instance to vlan mapping The revision number is used like a tracker of the changes made into the region each new change should incresase the value by one It should match on every switch on the same region Region and revision number must be configured always to prevent any STP problem on the network Hope it is useful RVCE HiRegion is configured to prevent a misconfiguration imagine 2 o more switches configured with the same instance but the instances have different vlan groups so the region will be used to identify which vlan groups belong to the each instance Note it should never happen it should be a misconfiguration The switches on the same region must run the same MST ParametersWithin a region all the switches must run instance of MST that includes  MST Configuration name Revision number 0 to 65535 Instance to vlan mapping The revision number is used like a tracker of the changes made into the region each new change should incresase the value by one It should match on every switch on the same region Region and revision number must be configured always to prevent any STP problem on the network Hope it is useful RVCE Hi VinothIn addition to Julios response you have asked whether it is required to configure a revision and a region name when creating a MST configurationBoth the revision number and the region name are mandatory parts of MST region configuration However if you do not specify them explicitly the switch will automatically use a revision number of 0 and an empty string as the region name So technically you do not need to configure them but they will always be present and if you dont change them they will be set to 0 for revision and to an empty string for the region name by defaultBest regardsPeter
OSPF Help,We have just installed the MPLS circuit and want to start routing some traffic over it weve got backups working over it using PBR but we want to put some more critical traffic over it so would like to be able to route over MPLS as default but if the MPLS fails it routes the traffic over the WAN My first thought was OSPF but Ive had not exposure to OSPF and wondered if anyone could give me some pointers on how I would go about configuring OSPF for this scenarioRouting to the WAN is all static using the Gateway of Last Resort the WAN itself is OSPF and RIP v2 but its all managed for us and we cant make any changes to the way the routing works Dont Ask its very painful at times  See below a basic diagram of the network Any help would be much appreciated Thanks Jon,HiYou can use OSPF Shamlink to have a backdoor as backup please check these linkshttpnetworkinfernonetcciestudyospfshamlinkhttpswwwciscocomcenustddocsiosxmliosiprouteospfconfiguration15syiro15sybookiroshamlinkhtmlHope it is useful RVCE The WAN is point to point circuits in a ring and not an MPLS cloud So not sure the SHAM link would work in our scenario ThanksJon RVCE You could establish a GRE tunnel across the MPLS and then establish OSPF peers across that You may have to tweak mtu and mss and depending on the platform and amount of traffic there may be a performance hit Things to consider but doableHope this helps
ASR 920  BFD echo  far end not matching QoS policymap,Topology is simple  two ASR 920 routers directly connected with a 1 Gbps copper cable Interfaces configured as a regular 30 routed interface on each side IGP  ISIS We use 10ms x 3 detections for BFD with echo we have to use a bfdtemplate to accomplish aggressive timers 50ms We are on latest code 3164The problem is as follows  we see no packets match our QoS policy map applied egress on either side We know that the echo packet is originated by router A and put on the wire as PAK priority We see the packets leave router A and hit the far end router B marked CS6 We see the packets turning around and leaving router B heading back to router A still marked CS6 We do not see any packets matching the egress QoS policymap in any classes CS6 classdefault etcI know the ASR 9k requires far end egress QoS to protect BFD under congestion But this ASR 920 seems to behave differentlyI am having problems finding supporting documentation TAC is having problems getting this to work for us SR 681187159,I removed all QoS policymaps and oversubscribed the backbone BFD interfaces BFD remained stable in a 10 ms by 3 echo configuration Im not sure if Im just lucky or if the echo packet on the remote router is somehow being given PAK priority and its just not documented RVCE I was searching for the same answer and it does appear that BFD automatically recieves priority From the following articlehttpswwwciscocomcenustddocsrouterscrssoftwarecrsr42qosconfigurationguidebqoscg421crsbqoscg421crschapter0101html If no QoS policy is attached to the interface on which BFD echo packets are received and switched back then the BFD echo packets are marked as vital packets when received and are sent to the high priority queue in the ingressq ASIC reserved for transit control traffic If ingress QOS policy is present on the interface on which BFD echo packets are received and switched back then the BFD echo packets are marked as vital packets when received and all QOS actions of the matching class except for taildrop and WRED are performed on the packets The packets are then sent to the high priority queue in the ingressq ASIC reserved for transit control traffic overriding the queue selected by the ingress QOS policy In the egress direction the BFD echo packets are treated like other vital packets locally originated control packets and are sent to the high priority queue of the interface in the egressq ASIC
IPSec Site to Site VPN no ISAKMP,Hi I have a cisco 887 and a cisco 881 and I am trying to set up an IPSec tunnel between the two It doesnt look like I am getting any ISAKMP negotiations between the two The policies are the same on both sides and the crypto map ACL are mirroring eachother but still no negotiation Can anybody assist,I think at minimum you are going to need some ACL entries on each end allowing the following  permit esp host xxxx host yyyypermit udp host xxxx host yyyy eq isakmppermit udp host xxxx host yyyy eq non500isakmp Replacing with your own IP addresses The ACL will be inbound on the Outside Interface RVCE Crypto maps  do your devices support VTI tunnels
Need help setting up QoS on a 3850 at a remote site,I have a 3850 which serves as the core switch at a remote site The gig interface leading to the upstream provider set to 100mbps which is the upstream bandwidth is showing several bursts of discards during the day as well as an equal number of transmit errors which seem to match a known bug Weve had complaints of slow file transfers to our central office Port AlignErr FCSErr XmitErr RcvErr UnderSize OutDiscardsGi1023 0 0 7412585 0 0 7412585 This switch was not set up with a servicepolicy for QoS and Im assuming this is something Im going to need to do Im a little rusty at QoS and Id like some help in getting it set up We have QoS set up atmany other sites non3850s for comparison,I havent worked with any 36503850 and although I believe their QoS is improved over the prior 36503750 series their default buffering may still require tuning to minimize drops See if your 3850s QoS chapter has any mention on adjusting QoS bufferingOn the prior 36503750 when you enabled QoS some buffer space was tied to each interfaces QoS queues even if all traffic was only using one queue or few interfaces I found reducing the interface queue reservations and allowing interfaces to grab additional buffers often dramatically reduced drops due to insufficient buffers Again this may not pertain to the 3850 but you might check

Difference between NIM and SPA in Cisco ASR series routers,I was wondering where I could find a list of what can be supported in a NIM which cant be supported in a SPA as it relates to expansion slots in Cisco ASR series routers The ASR1001X has 1 NIM slots and a SPA slot The ASR 1002HX has 2 NIM slots I found this link to be useful for seeing what SPAs are available but I cant seem to get a consistent answer as to what NIMs are available for the ASR Now backplane bandwidth aside I would think that you could plug any NIM into any NIM slot Am I wrong Solved Go to Solution,Im literally

OSPF Path Issue,Hi Guys Good day Would like to ask this issue Ive encountered From Branch A they accessing route 10110X from External We manipulated by adding metric from DC 100 and then from HQ is just the default one We tried turning off OSPF peer between HQISSW to BranchACS02 So far the output is good and working accordingly From Branch theyre using the 100 toward to DC But when we tried to revert turning up again OSPF peering between HQ and Branch Traffic went to Branch to HQ using the default metric Strange thing is route to 10110X is still using the higher metricWhich is not goodThis the only trace i get We can see on Wrong Path that Branch still using path with 100 metric Temporary solution we remove the 10110X in DC side so i will not be redistributed to OSPF So in Branch A the only route toward to 1011XX is Via HQ path Thank you,HiWhat happen is the link between branch and DC is down are your still receiving the route could you please execute show ip ospf database Thank you RVCE Hi No network interruption on all of the sites The only issue is that Branch A using the DC path to reach 1011XX which is not the planned and Because its using the 100 metricAs mentioned we removed 1011XX on DC so that when DC redistribute its route to OSPF 1011xx will not be includedRight now 1011XX from RID 193 which from HQ is active and in ospf database of Branch AIts just strange that it uses the higher metric 100 rather that the default one 
BGP MTU discovery,HiCan someone help me getting any brief document on PMTUD support for BGP How it works when to enable when to disable etcI have tried several Cisco sites but did not able to find a brief one Thanks for your help RegardsGodwin S,HiIt is useful when you have devices with different MTU configured basically packets passing through of different devices with different MTU configured on their interfacesTo configure neighbor xxxx transport pathmtudiscovery  also check the attachment reference httpswwwciscocomcenustddocsiosxmliosiproutebgpconfigurationxe3sirgxe3sbookconfiguringbgpneighborsessionoptionspdf This link could be usefulhttpnagendrakumarnagendrablogspotcom201003bgppathmtudiscoveryhtml  RVCE Hi GodwinIn addition to Julios points let me share some thoughtsYou already know the obvious Path MTU Discovery helps two communcating endpoints discover the maximum size of a packet that can pass between them unfragmented This is done by sending out packets with the DF bit set and listening to incoming ICMP Fragmentation Needed messages to understand whether the packets toward a particular peer should be made smallerThe mechanism of PMTUD is not really BGPspecific it is implemented in IP and TCP drivers and BGP just sets the necessary options on the TCP socket when it creates it so that the PMTUD in the TCPIP stack of the router can kick in If you are interested in the nittygritty details check out RFC 1191 for the PMTUD mechanism itself and perhaps also RFC 2923 for a discussion of some pitfalls that have been discovered sinceNote that PMTUD does not make sense for eBGP peers that are directly connected backtoback These peers share the same link and so are supposed to be using the same MTU different MTUs on both sides of this link would constitute a misconfiguration and would not be detected by PMTUD anywaySo the PMTUD makes only sense for iBGP or eBGP neighbors that are at least one hop away of each other note that for eBGP this is a rare scenario As a matter of rule PMTUD is always a good thing if you can ensure that the ICMP Fragmentation Needed messages will not be blocked somewhere along the path Sadly exactly because many firewall and ACL implementations are overzealous these messages are often dropped breaking the PMTUD entirelyWhether the PMTUD will make any difference is questionable Assuming that you would use the PMTUD for iBGP neighbors it is still your network your AS and youre the master of all things there including MTUs Usually if possible MTUs are the same along the entire network so PMTUD would not really be kicking into action In situations where you have mixed MTUs PMTUD would obviously be useful to haveA couple of things to consider Best regardsPeter RVCE I believe Ive noticed if you enable general PMTUD on a router BGP then by default uses itJulio and Peter have also mentioned different MTU sizes along a path between BGP peers but I believe Ive also noticed if PMTUD isnt enable BGP will use an MTU of 576 for offnet destinations Ie in situation where you know you have standard 1500 MTU Ethernet it wont be used without PMTUD enabledIn general I think it useful to always have in enabled Exceptions would be for cases where using is going to cause an issueAlso on the subject of enabling PMTUD Ive also found increasing the default size of the devices TCP RWIN might also increase BGP initial route transfers between peers

ISP best practice,Hi all Is it better to manage my Core routers gateway with public ip or can i make it private ip i tried using private ip and base on traceroute my private ip is exposed does it matter with direct internet or dedicated internet clients seeing a private ip in traceroute or if you can provide me any guide or articles for a Startup internet service provider like providing hotspot and serving OTT other that cisco press Thanks all,HiA public IP is configured on the interface facing to the Internet provider and most of the time the device is a firewall or a router with firewall IOS I suggest manage the devices with a internal IP address private it is by security purposes RVCE I think i have read some guides that ISP core routers should use routable internet address
Identify VLAN source,HiWeve about 300 Cisco devices in our networkCouple of weeks ago ive noticedabout 30 new vlans appeared on all the L3 devicesI can confirm that all these vlans do not belong to our networkI tried to identify source of these foreign vlansbut no success Can anybody please advice me how it will be possible find the source device where these vlans are coming from Thank you,Hi therePlease clarify the Layer2 VLAN definitions appearded in the VLAN databases or the Layer3 SVIs appeared in the running config cheersSeb RVCE HiThe VLANs cannot be created by themselves so you could verify your Syslog servers or configure archive to collect more information about who configured it You should verify your VTP configuration as well RVCE Seb asks a good question about whether we are talking about layer 2 vlans or layer 3 SVI Assuming that it is layer 2 vlans then probably the next question is what vtp mode the switches are in and what switches are masters in vtp HTH Rick RVCE Hi Thanks for your repliesWith one of our core 4500X i can see vlans in run config also With other L3 and L2 switches foreign VLANs are shown in vlan database The issue is we have wan links from few providers and i can determine by vlan name these vlans are belongs to other companiesIve contacted already all of our providersbut nobody of them confirmed the problem as own RVCE Are you running VTP ie not transparent on the switches in questions It seems unlikely that you would have the same VTP domain name configured as your WAN providers but not impossible vtp domain ciscoIf you are running VTP client server what is the output of sh vtp status  This will give us a clue as to the where abouts of the VTP serverIf you arent using VTP and VLANs are appearing in your database which havent been configured by your network team then you have a more serious security situtation to deal with cheersSeb RVCE Thanks for the additional information If you do see the vlans in show run of one of your 4500 then it is likely that someone added those vlans by configuring that switch So then the question becomes who has access to configure that switch And the question is also whether you have any logging enabled that might show who made those changes I agree with Seb that it is unlikely though possible that the new vlans were learned from the ISP show vtp status would be a good way to gather information that might be helpful HTH Rick RVCE HiFrom my knowledge even if switch does not have any VTP configured will be in null domain will accept the vtp configurationincluding domain name from other switches and update it in its database This is applicable only if new switch in null domain So I am suspecting this might be the case here Still not sure if we can track from where the VLAN information is sourced by using sh vtp status output I think we need to run this on all switches to see which one is master Please advise me if there is any other option to get this

DMVPN Phase3 with 4 hubs  Only 2 NHS responding,We have a fully working DMVPN phase3 where each spoke with 1 internet uplink has 4 different mGRE tunnels to 4 different Hubs for redundancy purposes All is working fine all tunnels are passing traffic just fine but for some reason always only 2 NHS are responding to NHRP reqInteresting enough when we shutdown Tun1 and shutunshut Tun0 suddenly Tun0 NHS starts responding At the end there are always max 2 NHS which are responding This is definitely not what we would expect in normal situation Interesting enough we can reproduce the same behavior in the lab Do you think this is normal Debugging the NHRP NHS packets is also very interesting  it shows that the NHS actually responds but the response packet comes to wrong mGRE tunnelHere is a debug from a working Tunnel interfaceHere is debug from nonresponding Tunnel interface,For those who are interested I have worked with TAC on this who was very helpful It turns out the issue above is caused by us somehow ending up using same GRE tunnel keys for a pair of tunnels Tun0Tun1 and Tun2Tun3 which had the same source interface This is a known limitation that I completely forgot about The router is somehow not able to tell which incoming packet belongs to which GRE tunnel even though the tunnel crypto proxy acls for each tunnel are different and uses GRE tunnel key for that RVCE This helped me resolve an issue with dmvpn tunnels in iWAN where the internet connections were commodity connections from a single provider that didnt provide a Static IPThe internet providers routers were offering an internal IP of 1011010My Interface was set to vrf INET  ip address dhcp with a route of ip route vrf INET default dhcpI had several of these devices configured this way but their internet tunnel wouldnt stay upshow dmvpn would often show the Static connections as NHRP instead of UPI believe what was happening is SiteA connects to the Data Center Router builds its IPSec Tunnel with the Unique Internet IP then GRE uses the 1011010 Internal IP to build out its tunnel When SiteB connects the router builds its IPSec Tunnel with its own unique internet IP but when it goes to build the GRE tunnel the data center router says I already have a 1011010 registered and youre not itThe solution is to use a unique static internal IP on all of the routersinstead of ip address dhcp use ip address 1011020 for SiteA and 1011021 for SiteBIf you have DSL service that gives you a 1921681x IP make sure theyre uniqueSiteA 192168120SiteB 192168121Thank you for following up with your solution Im sure this information has helped quite a few others like myselfStas

ip nat inside source static network with routemap,How would you use ip nat inside source static network with an routemap The specific situation isInside LAN 1921681024The inside LAN address should be NATd to 1723011024 only if the traffic is going to 1723010024 I have tried the following with no luckip accesslist extended natacl permit ip 19216810 000255 17230100 000255routemap natmap permit 10 match ip addres nataclip nat inside source static network 19216810 17230110 24 routemap natmapHowever if the routemap is not specified in the ip nat inside source static network the translation works for all trafficOn the other side I was able to set this up with ip nat pool and routemapip nat inside source list natacl routemap natmap pool natpoolip nat pool natpool 17230110 1723011255 netmask 2552552550 type matchhostAny advice is appreciatedThanks,ZhenThe way you have set it up is the correct way although if you are not matching on something other than source  destination IP addresses you could just as easily have doneip nat inside source list natacl pool natpool ie you only need a routemap if you want to match on other things such as nexthop ip addressoutput interface etcYou would not use the static statement  ip nat inside source static network 19216810 17230110 24 routemap natmap because you are dynamically Natting source IP addresses not statically mapping themHope this makes senseJon RVCE Indeed I do need static onetoone mapping so that outside host from 1723010024 can access the internal host 1821681024 via the natd outside address 1723011024 RVCE ZhenSorry i didnt explain it properly Even though you want a one to one mapping you are still dynamically allocating them as needed ie until traffic passes through the router the NAT translation is not there and after a period of inactivity the translation is removedJon RVCE Hello Jon and Zhenxu I will revive this thread because I have similar if not the same problem policy NAT on IOSInside LAN 1013696020The inside LAN address should be NATd to 1010896020 ONLY if the traffic is going to 10203208024But I need it to work both waysI am able to make it work with sessions initiated in one direction from 1013696x to 10203208y but not both directions  10203208024 to 1010896020 as well ip accesslist extended NATAB permit ip 10136960 0015255 102032080 000255routemap rmnat permit 10 match ip address NATABip nat pool netx 10108960 10108111255 prefixlength 20 type matchhostip nat inside source routemap rmnat pool netx I tried to do it with ACLs and it worked the same wayone wayI tried to add ip nat inside destination with similar logic but that caused the condition to be neglectedand all traffic from 1013696020 ended up translatedI tried to use reversible option on top of using routemap scenario but that only creates general entry in the NAT table for specific entries created in the first step so eg if I do ping from SA10136968 to DA102032081 the router correctly translates it to SA10108968 DA102032081 and I am able to ping in the opposite direction  from 102032081 to 10108968But I can not initiate session from 102032081 to anything else than 10108968So reversible is not ment as remedy for this situation I do not have option routemap available in ip nat static network A B Xwhich would be the simpliest scenario if it was working please help on how to do this if possibleThank youLeo RVCE Hi LeoThe reverse ping from 102032081 to 10108968 was working because it was already presented in NAT translation table due to your initial ping SA10136968 to DA102032081 hits the routemap and trigerred NATThe reason it was not pinging from 102032081 to anything else is that there is no translation for other destination apart from 10108968 in NAT table so far Note For dynamic NAT inside the traffic should be initiated from inside to outside Not from outside to inside RVCE Thank you for your replyI probably wrote the question in a wrong wayThe question is how to do it so I can initiate traffic from outside andhave the same behaviourThank you
Cisco to Azure via expressroute ,Does anyone have any real world experience of implementing Azure MS expressroute using multiple dedicated circuits routing private address space over eBGP private peering and connecting to public services over eBGP public peeringi have a few ideas regarding private peering eg as your azure environment is seen as an extension of your own network i would probably advertise my internal subnets within a vrf on my external routers and the redistribute into a seperate addressfamily in BGP seperating this from the global RT Id be interested in hearing other ways this can be achieved Or are there any performance impacts with redistribution of routesThe public peering seems more of a problem Does anyone have any practical examplesscenarios of how this would be configuredthanks,Hello just to be clear you want private and public peering on the same device  Either way with the Cisco virtual router functionallity which is supported on the XR platform as far as I know you wouldnt even need a VRF but could simply run two separate BGP processes on the same device If you dont have the virtual router VRF sounds like a good option As with regard to public peering the Cisco side is pretty straight forward The link below section 2 has a sample config for setting up eBGP peering with Microsoft httpsdocsmicrosoftcomenusazureexpressrouteexpressrouteconfigsamplesrouting Not sure if this is in any way useful but I have also included a link to a document that describes how to set up private and public peering using the Azure portal and the Resource Manager httpsdocsmicrosoftcomnlnlazureexpressrouteexpressroutehowtoroutingportalresourcemanager RVCE Hi Georg Thank you for your reply Unfortunately i dont have access to the XR code only XE I do not believe i can have multiple bgp sessions using XE Correct me if im wrong I have seen the microsoft docs previously and they do appear straightforward at first glance however theyre approach does not factor in security from the customer premises view point and is rather simplified From what i gather the public peering allows users to access MS public servicesaddresses using the dedicated expressroute The relevant subnets from MS would be advertised through eBGP As a hypothetical If i had a firewall in multiple context mode with all internal traffic having a default route to the primary context and i wanted to create a new context for cloud services public peering How would i be able to direct all traffic to Azure public services without using specific static routes MS public expressrouteedge router FW multiple contextsL3 switchINTERNAL users networkops RVCE Hello as far as I remember the ASA in multiple context mode supports only one global AS similar to one AS for all address families in IOS Either way what Cisco router do you have on your edge  RVCE Currently have the asr1001x series RVCE What your describing is exactly what Im in the middle of configuring with excatly the same devices Our ISP is presnting our express route connection as a VLAN down our connection to them so Im having to peer with our perimeter routers or introduce some layer 2 between our routers and theirs What Ive settled on is our internet traffic will route via the global table on our ASRs and Im pulling the Azure Private routes into a VRF ultimatley presenting it at our perimeter firewalls Theoretically the Azure Public peering could be implimented the same way within a VRF or just hit the Global Table We have no plans to impliment the public peering down Express Route because of the amount of bandwidth we have to our ISP

Not able to ping between networks,HiI have 2 SSID with different network ip and dhcp pools When I try to ping from one device on one to another device on the other it always says that it has timed out and never goes through They are both broadcasting from the same radio on the router Is there something I need to do to enable this thanks EDIT Ive got it to work now not sure what it was but it works,Hello I remember you posting earlier with questions about configuring a 1941wis this problem related  Can both clients ping their defauly gateway  Post the config of the device you have this configured on RVCE helloYes it related to the previous post I can ping from the console window of the router to the default gateway Ive attached the config for both router and ap as it would be too long to post both RVCE HiIf you are able to ping both gateways from the router also you could disable the window firewall RVCE Hello the VLAN 1 interface on your router and the BVI 1 interface on the AP must be in the same address space which right now they are not interface Vlan1 ip address 1010030 2552552550 interface BVI1 ip address 192168201 2552552550 no ip routecache Make sure to change one of the addresses so that both are in the same subnet eg interface Vlan1ip address 192168202 2552552550 interface BVI1ip address 192168201 2552552550no ip routecache RVCE I did some testing and I can ping to other devices but they cant ping back to the windows machine I also noticed that windows machines are the ones that cannot be pinged to as the ping will work both ways on a mac and linux machine Is disabling the firewall a reason that the ping may not go through RVCE Yes the firewall and antivirus could block icmp packets
QoS on WAN router LAN inf,Hi there Thanks for readingI have a router which is saturating the MPLS circuit attached to it The provider is naturally policing us down to SLA The site is a possibly an 8Class model but probably a 4Class model I want to apply artificial backpressure and queue by businesscritical AF31 markings Is there a nice neat name for thisThanksBob Solved Go to Solution,Perhaps what you seek is a hierarchal CBWFQ policy where the parent policy contains a default class shaper and the child policy priorities as you desire The latter could be a 4 or 8 class or other number of classes policy RVCE Hello Bob what are you looking for  A configuration example for 8 or 4Class WAN Edge DiffServ models  Please clarify RVCE Hi GregThanks for writingIm looking to classifymark policemarkdown and schedule I only have 2 or 3 business critical apps and phones I want to mark them AF31 and limit the entire stream going exiting the router to stop overflowing our WAN circuit which is currently dropping packets because were surpassing our limits Were going to offload the COS prioritizing from the ISP onto our own hardwareThanks again for writingBob RVCE QoS features can vary much per platform and can also vary by IOS version andor feature set and even sometimes by specific interface typeFor suggested QoS youll need to fully identify your platform and the interface RVCE Hi JosephWe have an ISR 4331 running 031603S with Gig interfaces connecting to WAN and LANThanksBob RVCE Ok in that case your device supports most QoS featuresAgain what you might want is policies likepolicymap sampleParentclass classdefaultshape average cirservicepolicy sampleChildpolicymap sampleChildclass realtimepriory percent 33class criticalbandwidth remaining percent 66fairqueueclass classdefaultbandwidth remaining percent 33fairqueueinterface gige servicepolicy output sampleParent RVCE Perhaps what you seek is a hierarchal CBWFQ policy where the parent policy contains a default class shaper and the child policy priorities as you desire The latter could be a 4 or 8 class or other number of classes policy RVCE Hi JosephThanks for the guidance This aligns with what ive been seeing in the Branch Router QoS guidelines HQoS with Parentchild I was looking for a confirmation that with the info available to you it appeared I was on the right pathThanks againBob
Number of stack cables for two 3650,Dear community Have a simple question about stacking of two cisco 3650 devicesHow many stacking cables are needed in that case Just one or are two needed in total crossed connection The manual or other picture show mostly 3 devices in a stack like hereMaybe someone can answer my question  thx hoschi Solved Go to Solution,HiYou need 2 in order to close the circuit and for redundancy Just for reference httpswwwciscocomcenussupportdocsswitchescatalyst3750seriesswitches71925cat3750createswitchstkshtml  RVCE HiYou need 2 in order to close the circuit and for redundancy Just for reference httpswwwciscocomcenussupportdocsswitchescatalyst3750seriesswitches71925cat3750createswitchstkshtml  RVCE May thx for the quick answer  RVCE It was a pleasure have a great day RVCE As Julio has noted you need two for redundancy  Stack will operate on just one but then of course you have no redundancy Two cables also increase bandwidth between the two stack membersUsually short stack cables are crisscrossed as shown but you could also connect stack port 1 to stack port 1 and stack port 2 to stack port 2 Doing so should allow a bit more vertical separation of the stack members

Dynamic routing over fex,We have a N93180YXEX with straightthrough N2248TP attachedWe have a 100Mb router thats connected to the FEXWe want to run dynamic routing BGP between the attached router and N93180YXEX In the cisco documentation we see the following When you connect a FEX to a Cisco Nexus 9000 series device the queuing capability on the FEX host interface is limited A router that is connected to a Layer 2 using SVI interfaces cannot participate in routing protocol adjacency The FEX cannot be used as a peer because when congestion occurs on the FEX host interface the control plane traffic is not prioritized This limitation also applies to the FEX when it is connected to other Layer 3 devices such as an ASA firewall an ACE load balancer or other Layer 3 networking devices that are running a dynamic routing protocol Static routes to routers ASA firewalls ACE load balancers and other Layer 3 network devices are supported But i also read the following Beginning with Cisco NXOS Release 703I42 Layer 3 is supported on FEX interfaces and subinterfaces on Cisco Nexus 9300 Series switches Is it possible if we configure the FEX host interface as a layer 3 subinterface that dynamic routing works over this interface Thanks for your help,

Understanding the significance of Wight attribute in BGP Best Path Selection,Why does Cisco use Weight for BGP path selection process whereas others dont use it Is there a specific significance for it ,Since it is locally significant to BGP router you can use it to load balance traffic in scenario where you have 1 router and 2 BGP neighbors and want ot load balance traffic Configure higher weight for specific neighbor on some NLRI that is advertised from both neighbors and traffic will be forwarded according to configured weight attribute Configuration exampleaccesslist 10 permit 19216800 000255accesslist 20 permit 1721600 000255routemap ISP1 permit 10 match ip address 10 set weight 500routemap ISP1 permit 20routemap ISP2 permit 10 match ip address 20 set weight 500routemap ISP2 permit 20router bgp 65500 neighbor 10001 routemap ISP1 in neighbor 1010101 routemap ISP2 in The same principle can be used to route traffic on any BGP router in the network however it will create additional administrative overhead just as routing traffic with static routes RVCE HiThere are many ways to manipulate path for BGP paths they are known as BGP attributes or in some cases BGP parameters There is a list of BGP attributes and it has an order Weight is a Cisco only parameter it is local significant for the router where it is configured basically it is ideal when you are not using iBGP on your network infrastructure basically used on the border routers having eBGP peering only in order to select a best way over other The higher Weight value is always preferred If you have an iBGP network I suggest to use Local Preference because the LP value is transmitted on the local AS I suggest the following link for additional information httpswwwciscocomcenussupportdocsipbordergatewayprotocolbgp1375325htmlhttpnetcertsnetbgppathattributesandthedecisionprocess Hope it is useful RVCE The original post asks why did Cisco create this unique vendor specific attribute I believe that the answer is that Cisco wanted to go beyond the standard features identified in the RFC which specifies this routing protocol and which every vendor must implement to provide a unique capability Weight is very similar to Local Preference They both provide a way for a router to prefer certain prefixes learned from one neighbor over those prefixes learned from other neighbors If you have a single router running BGP to multiple neighbors then it would not matter whether you use Weight or Local Preference to prefer certain prefixes from one of the neighbors You would get the same results with either method of establishing preference But if you have multiple routers in your network running BGP and with multiple routers running BGP you should be running IBGP between your routers then there is a difference If router A learns a prefix ans assigns a Local Preference to it then it will advertise that prefix to router B with that Local Preference and both routers will have the same degree of preference for that route But what if router A leanrs a prefix and wants to assign a preference but you do not necessarily want router B to have that same preference In that case the unique Cisco attribute of Weight can accomplish what you need This is the reason why Cisco created the Weight attribute in BGP HTH Rick
BGP routes when OSPF routes are unavailable,HelloHere is my simplified network layout AS and IPs are made up for privacyAs you can see we own one 20 and we have two locations connected to two different Internet peers Network 1 is announcing the whole 20 and Network 2 is announcing the same IP space broken up in two 21 The more specific BGP announcement wins Both locations are also connected via a Metro Ethernet connection and both sides are part of OSPF area 0 Both locations are also BGP peering with each other Routing between both locations works fine so does the BGP routing to our peers Should Internet Peer 1 fail traffic makes it just fine to Network 1 via Internet Peer 2 and its connected Metro ethernet So basically everything is working great as long as the Metro Ethernet link between Network 1 and Network 2 is up If the Metro Ethernet connection fails I can no longer reach resources on the other network The plan is that traffic should go over the internet if the Metro Ethernet connection is down When I do a traceroute while the Network Ethernet is down from Network 1 to Network 2 the route goes to Null 0 Since OSPF cant communicate with the other network traffic destined to the other network goes to Null0 However BGP still has a valid default route to the internet Also please note that traffic originated from the internet and destined to other network will reach the destination just fineThe question is What do I need to do so that I can still reach the other network from each location when the Metro Ethernet connection failsI can post configs if neededThanks for your helpJB Solved Go to Solution,JB Thanks for the additional information I certainly understand that you need to perform some aggregation because you can not advertise anything smaller than 24 to your upstream What I was trying to suggest is that there is more than one way to perform that aggregation 1 use the aggregate address command This produces a summary route and puts a null route into the routing table to protect against routing loops but it has the possibility to black hole traffic when the Metro E is not working 2 use a static route for the summary This produces a summary route and does not put a null route into the routing table So it does not have potential to black hole traffic but does have potential for routing loops So there are pluses and minuses for each alternative It is a tradeoff You should choose which to use realizing the implications of the choice and selecting the one that you think is the best fit for your environment I am a bit puzzled at part of your response You say that the addresses are not intermingled and each side has a unique set of addresses But your post says that 1110 is on one side and 1120 is on the other side To make things work you need to be able to advertise the individual 24 But you do not want BGP to advertise many 24 but to aggregate That is why I suggest that a GRE tunnel would be a good solution to your issue It would allow the individual sites to see details from the other site but would allow BGP to only advertise the summarized routes HTH Rick RVCE It appears your problem is the summary null 0 route in the rib Now I am not sure if this is the best way to fix the problem but you can remove the null route from both edge routers and that should fix the problem or you will need to come up with a summary address that doesnt overlap 1110 with 1120 Below is the config to remove null route router ospf xx discardroute internal 255 RVCE cofee0400 You correct I do have null routes in my rib sho ip

from network 1 or 2 B 111021 2000 via 0000 7w0d Null0 B 118021 2000 via 0000 7w0d Null0  Can you also provide null 0 static route entries from both networks that are used to advertise in BGP I think what happens is when you lose the metro Ethernet connection you also lose specific routes that are attached to the other network and since you have null 0 for loop prevention the traffic is sent there so it never makes to your default gateway RVCE coffee0400 Thanks again for your help I dont have any static Null routes in any of my routers I think the Null routes are created by bgp in response to the aggregation see post above The null routes become a black hole if my Metro ethernet connection fails because the traffic does not go out the default gateway as intended Any more info Thanks JB RVCE But you shouldnt be able to advertise a prefix in BGP if its not installed in the global RIB How the router is learning that prefix RVCE The prefix is learned through OSPF and advertised because of a matching bgp network statement network 1140 mask 2552552550 JB RVCE Thanks Removing summary only wouldnt stop injecting a null route with summary only key word it suppresses advertising of specific prefixes from aggregated space Its the aggregate address network command that causes null route injection RVCE For the sake of keeping my help request simple I simplified my network layout quite a bid The conceptional idea however is the same We actually have several 20 and 21 IP prefixes that we break out based on usage So its not uncommon to have one 20 broken out in anything from a 30 to a 24 Since I advertise to my Internet provider a minimum of a 24 I need to aggregate all my small prefixes Now that you have a good understanding of my problem do you think your previous suggestion of using discardroute internal 255 is still valid Please let me know Thanks again JB RVCE Actually that was for ospf null route I was under the impression that edge router was learning the summary address from ospf and then advertise in BGP What if you remove aggregate address from bgp and use network command to advertise those prefixes For that you can either create a static route for the prefix that needs to be advertised or may be use ospf advertise a summary route but not sure if that would be possible using ospf without knowing ospf topology Below is what you can do ip route 1110 2552552480 xxxx next hop address bgp xxx network 1110 mask 2552552480 no aggregateaddress 1110 2552552480  or if you dont want to do that then may be you can create specific static routes pointing towards default route that you lose when metro Ethernet connection is down You can create those static routes with a higher administrative then iBGP so they will only be installed when you lose connection to another site through metro Ethernet let me know if that makes sense RVCE Hello When you lose your IBGPIGP link both sites are still advertsing the aggregate to either ISP and as such the ISP still sees the summary coming from its peered site and also you have a null route still in the rib blackholing becasue of itWhy not just advertise all specifc networks to both ISPs and negate the summerisation and make sure you dont be come a transit for either ISP by just advertising you local routes and nothing elseresPaul Please dont forget to rate any posts that have been helpfulThanks RVCE Paul Thanks for your help I have removed summaryonly from the aggregateaddress command on both routers and after clear ip bgp  soft checked if I still have the null routes in my rib As you can see below I continue to have the Null routes present within my rib FYI I advertise the address space on both routers with different prefixes to have inbound routes reach the router handling the specific IP space directlyand to provide redundancy in case of an outage to one of my BGP peers Router 1 aggregateaddress 1110 2552552480 Router 1sh ip bgp neighbors xxxx advertisedroutes BGP

the Metro Ethernet connecting router 1 and router 2 fails Any more tips Thanks JB RVCE JB There are some things that we do not know about your network which might affect the suggestions that we would make such as the distribution of networkssubnets between sites whether the sites are using public IP addressing inside the site does not use NAT or uses private addressing inside and does NAT for Internet access But based on what we know so far I believe that there are several aspects of your situation that we can discuss  the null route in the routing table This is a normal behavior of aggregate addressIf you think about it we can understand this from several perspectives A It is a basic behavior of BGP that the protocol will not advertise a route to the neighbors that is not in the routing table So when you use aggregate address to advertise a summary regardless of whether you use summary only BGP needs that summary address to be in the routing table and so aggregate address creates the null route B The behavior of aggregate address is very similar to the behavior of summary address in EIGRP or the behavior of summarization in OSPF When these routing protocols create a summary address they create a null route for it  There is an advantage of using aggregate address in that BGP will advertise the summary only if one or more included address blocks are in the active routing table So if there are no constituent routes then the summary is not advertised If you want this behavior then you need to use aggregate address and have the null route in the routing table If the null route is causing issues as may be the case here then you need to look for an alternative which would be to configure a static route for the summary If you configure a static route for the summary then you can use the address of the next hop router as the next hop in the static route and it will not black hole traffic  Note that using a static route instead of aggregate address involves a trade off You get the advantage of not black holing traffic but you lose the protection against potential routing loops So consider the pluses and minuses and choose which technique you want to use  I believe that there is another issue when you advertise the 20 from site 1 and advertise two 21 from site 2 Remember that a basic principle of IP routing is that longest match wins So site 1 will know that it should go to site 2 for an address that is not local to site 1 site 1 has learned two 21 routes in addition to its 20 But consider what happens at site 2 When it needs to reach a destination that is not local it looks in the routing table finding the 20 from site 1 but also finding the 21s Longest match says that 21 wins and it would not send traffic to site 1  There appears to be another issue if your example truly represents what is going on in your network You show 1110 in site 1 and 1120 in site 2 If the subnets are truly intermingled like that then determining what is a destinatino within the site or what is remote becomes quite challenging OSPF running over the Metro E solves this But what to do is Metro E is down and OSPF is not communicating I would suggest that the solutin would be to configure a GRE tunnel that runs between sites over the Internet Use OSPF through the tunnel and manipulate the metric that that it is less attractiveThis would allow you to route accurately between sites and also provides a solution to the question of null routes HTH Rick RVCE PaulThanks for your response…Here are some answers to some of the questions you’ve asked “There are some things that we do not know about your network which might affect the suggestions that we would make such as the distribution of networkssubnets between sites whether the sites are using public IP addressing inside the site does not use NAT or uses private addressing inside and does NAT for Internet access” The two routers in my scenario do not use NAT nor do they use private IP addressing All IPs are public IPs owned by us and address assignments do not intermingle between the two sides For example a 24 out of the 20 is only utilized on one side of the network Although the 24 might be broken down further into smaller blocks ie 29s they are still only utilized on one side of the networkYou are 100 correct the Null route is the product of the BGP aggregation statements The aggregates are needed because I can’t obviously not announce anything less then a 24 to my upstream provider Since most of my IP space is broken up in anything from 30s to 24s I will need to aggregate the space before I can announce it to by upstream provider“There appears to be another issue if your example truly represents what is going on in your network You show 1110 in site 1 and 1120 in site 2 If the subnets are truly intermingled like that then determining what is a destination within the site or what is remote becomes quite challenging OSPF running over the Metro E solves this But what to do is Metro E is down and OSPF is not communicating” …and this is exactly what is going on… OSPF is working great making sure that both sides can communicate with each other… but once the the Metro Ethernet is down all hell breaks looseI like the idea of the GRE tunnel to maintain the OSPF routing between both sides It’s easy to configure and will hopefully address issue ThanksJB

BGP across an interior domain,I have a OSPF domain across a region mainly 6500 switches thatmake up the distribution layers Off these are aggregation routers which is where we have customerBGP peerings These aggreagation routers are usually in each of the geographic areasCurrently there is no iBGP across the 6500s and the issue I face is we redistribute the customer BGProutes into OSPF but our interior routers arenly able to route based on the BGP metrics so wehave unfavourable routingWhilst I wasnt around when this was built I want to ensure it becomes more functionalThe 6500 have 1GB memory I am considering that we have an iBGP route reflector on each of hte 6500s and aggreagation routers back to our border routers and only on these nodes carry customer prefixes in our BGP tables and not full tables I would expect we only have around 200 customer 24s so I wouldnt think we would overwhelm the 6500s they are tupically sup720sI assume for this to work we would need to stop having our customer prefixes in OSPF and relyon IBGP tables This would allow our 6500s to route according to their BGP tablesCan anyone provide any feedback on the above is this the best path forward,HiI think you are receiving the BGP on the Edge routers right if You have an eBGP on the border routers you could just redistribute BGP into OSPF using routemaps  Prefixlists and applying metrictype type 1 preferred over type 2 or metrics lowest over higher to prefer a path over other You dont need to redistribute the OSPF routes into BGP on the border routers it can be sent to the peer using network command and prefix list or if it is possible using aggregate address You could use your scheme on the 6500 and use iBGP and RR on the border routers but take in consideration that could load the CPU with more routing processing because you will have 2 routing protocols working there Hope it is useful
BGP Routing  Multihomed,Hi All Ive come across a minor issue on our network which is something that hadnt crossed my mind when configuring our multihomed BGP environmentI am learning a destination from our least preferred peer within a 24 subnet I am learning the same destination from our preferred peer within a 23 subnetTherefore regardless of my localpreference configuration because the more specific route is being learnt traffic is going out via our least preferred transit peer What is the most efficient way to control this so our preferred transit stays preferred Thanks Colin,HiI think you shoud filter the traffic with prefixlists from both peers and associated that with your local preference values Exampleip prefixlist BGP seq 5 permit xxxx23 routemap ISP1 permit 5match ip address prefix BGPset localpreference 1000 routemap ISP2 permit 5match ip address prefix BGPset localpreference 500 router bgp 100neighbor 1111 routemap ISP1 inneighbor 2222 routemap ISP2 in Hope it is useful RVCE Thanks for the replySorry I should elaborate a bit more These peerings are downloading the full internet routing table and there are about 4000 prefix differences where a more specific subnet is being learnt from the least preferred transit judging by iBGP distribution So that would be an unmanageable approach to prefixlist that many  RVCE Do you recieve a 23 too from your lease preferred ISPYou can filter receving 24 or more specific prefixes from it ip pref BLOCKSPECIFIC deny 00000 ge 24ip pref BLOCKSPECIFIC permit 00000 ge lerouter bgp 123neighbor xxx prefixlist BLOCKSPECIFIC in this way you will have 2 23 paths and you can apply local pref or other traffic engineering technique to direct your traffic as you want Please test this in a LAB to make sure you will get the results you are expecting RVCE Duplicate post  Please dont forget to rate any posts that have been helpfulThanks RVCE HelloJust to add to julios post you could try using prefixlist to accomodate local preferanceip prefixlist STAN permit 000023ip prefixlist STAN2 permit 000024 routemap PreferredISP permit 10match ip address prefixlist STANset localpreference 20000routemap PreferredISP permit 99 routemap leastPreferredISP permit 10match ip address STAN2set localpreference 10000routemap leastPreferredISP permit 99router bgp xxneighbor xxxx routemap PreferredISP inneighbor xxxx routemap leastPreferredISP inIf that isnt applicable then you could try using a EEM script with an ASPath filter to match on the say a AS these prefixs originate from or transit through or even bothip aspath accesslist 5 deny 1111ip aspath accesslist 5 permit ip sla 10icmpecho xxxx sourceIP xxxxip sla schedule 10 life forever starttime nowtrack 1 rtr 10 reachabilityevent manager applet ISP1UPevent track 1 state upaction 50 cli command enableaction 51 cli command conf taction 52 cli command router bgp xxaction 53 cli command neighbour filterlist 5 inaction 54 cli command endevent manager applet ISP1DOWNevent track 1 state downaction 55 cli command enableaction 56 cli command router bgp xxaction 57 cli command no neighbour filterlist 5 inaction 58 cli command endresPaul Please dont forget to rate any posts that have been helpfulThanks

standby Now if you dont configure the priority both devices will be working as active you can see that through show standby vlan 50So you need to assign a device as active to enable the redundancy If the device active fails the standby will take the active role now imagine the previous active device is up again the preempt command will be in charge to remove the active status to the current device and assign the role back to the primary device the previous active Hope it is useful RVCE hi julio What happen actual when i connect the switch from another switch and from router r1 to switch 2 then

4451X throughput license performance doubt,Hi ciscomatesI have a doubt about licence performance into 4451X What is the meaning of 1 Gbps performance I think that the maximun throughput that I can achive in total adding each interface throughputIn example If I have a router for routing between two networks I can only reach 500 Mbps per interface Or If I need to route three networks I only can reach 1 Gbps in total  250 Mbps in two interfaces plus 500 in the third oneAm I correctThank you in advance,Disclaimer The Author of this posting offers the information contained within this posting without consideration and with the readers understanding that theres no implied or expressed suitability or fitness for any purpose Information provided is for informational purposes only and should not be construed as rendering professional advice of any kind Usage of this postings information is solely at readers own risk Liability Disclaimer In no event shall Author be liable for any damages wha2tsoever including without limitation damages for loss of use data or profit arising out of the use or inability to use the postings information even if Author has been advised of the possibility of such damage Posting I believe the license is for aggregate bandwidth through the backplane RVCE Thanks for reply Joseph More ideas or link reference to Joseph´s view RVCE Hello David Ive got the same question what is the performace license  Is cisco doing traffic shaping if we dont buy this license  or is it a limit on the CPU cores maybe some disabled till we activate the license  Regards RVCE Very late but yes you are correct davidsua

BGP one AS number multiple sites one ISP,HelloWe have a 22 internet address block We devided it into four 24 address blocks say A B C and DISP Z is the only ISP we peered with via BGP and address block A has been distributed thourgh themWe have only one AS numberThe company plans to build a remote location with a new BGP router assign address block B to it and also peer with ISP Z in that locationISP Z has many pops accross the country My question would be1 Will this plan work2 Can ISP Z exchange IP traffic between address block A and B for us3 If 2 can work do we still need to set up an iBGP session between our routers for address block A and B each router only has default route pointing to ISP Z and they dont exchange Internet routes 4 If wed like to save addres space would it be okay to ask ISP Z to further devide address block B to 26 chunk so we can save addresses for future sitesI know Internet routers would filter out routes smaller than 24 but we kind of delegating ISP Z for our 24 routes Thank you for reading my questions Andrew Solved Go to Solution,Hi As long as your ISP accepts your 26 advertisements this would workHow are you advertising the 24 Only a 24 BGP route to the ISP Or are you advertising the whole block 22If so you can still advertise the 24 at the main site while advertising the more specific 26 from the remote sites ISP Z will be responsible for advertising your address block on a 24 or a less specific summary upstream towards other ASes The most important things to consider is 1 Ask them if you can advertise this public block 26 so they can route between your more specific blocks2 Make sure they will advertise your networks to other ASes3 If you dont have a backdoor link there is no need to advertise a 24 or 22 network upstream since you wont know how to route to the more specifics needing ISP Z to route between them See the topo attached and let me know if I correctly addressed your question RVCE Hi As long as your ISP accepts your 26 advertisements this would workHow are you advertising the 24 Only a 24 BGP route to the ISP Or are you advertising the whole block 22If so you can still advertise the 24 at the main site while advertising the more specific 26 from the remote sites ISP Z will be responsible for advertising your address block on a 24 or a less specific summary upstream towards other ASes The most important things to consider is 1 Ask them if you can advertise this public block 26 so they can route between your more specific blocks2 Make sure they will advertise your networks to other ASes3 If you dont have a backdoor link there is no need to advertise a 24 or 22 network upstream since you wont know how to route to the more specifics needing ISP Z to route between them See the topo attached and let me know if I correctly addressed your question RVCE HiThank you very much for the quick response and diagram Yes the diagram shows what we plan to do correctly One more question Would using 26 block be troublesome down the road if we connect to a 2nd ISP and become multihomed Thank you RVCE Is your 22 block actually yours or does it belong to the provider Z If the 22 block belongs to you not a PA  provider assigned you are free to advertise a 22 to both providers  but in order to route between your sites ISP Z should also know the more specifics This way the internet will have 2 similar prefixes both 22 towards your AS using ISP Y and Z as transit If this 22 is a PA you should know beforehand how the internet sees your prefix Is it summarized down to a lets say 16 on ISP Z if so advertising a 22 to another provider would generate a more specific prefix in the global routing table point of view and ISP Y would be your primary way in inbound towards your AS In both cases since only provider Z would know the more specifics 26 of your other sites traffic would hit your main office and will be routed across ISP Z all the way to your remote sites Anyway BGP multihoming is a little more complicated design and there are a few key points to consider in order to prevent future issues Here is a very good doc that addresses many concerns related to BGP multihoming design Pay special attention to item 24 There are also practical examples throughout the doc httpaspathnetBGPMHingHOWTOwhitepaperpdf RVCE Hello Thank you again for this detailed explanation Yes we got this 22 block from APNIC Ill read the document you attached Thank you for spending time on this question Now we have the assurance and will implement site B Appreciate it Andrew
NAT  Accessing Website Through Outside Interface,Hello I was hoping for some guidance from someone who can offer any I am trying to get users to access devices through NAT from the inside using the external interface I have tried a domainless NAT configuration as well but I am back to what I guess youd call a more standard NAT as of now I know DNS plays into this as well so thank you for your help The windows domain is localdomaincom and main local network is 192168100 Users get primary DNS server through DHCP which is 192168102 with 8888 as secondary We are hosting our public website on 192168105 and we can access the website from the outside fine as Ive updated the public DNS records to our ISP IP address and inside as well as long as I point clients to the local IP address There has to be a way to access the webpage from the inside using the outside IP I would think Also concerning ACLs 110 and 111 would adding the statement  permit ip 192168100 000255 any  when assigning them to GigabitEthernet01 in keep traffic flowing normal Would I just need to add it to one or both ACLs If there is anything else in the configuration that looks off feel free to let me know Thank you for your help,Hello I am not clear on what you are asking Your current configuration looks fine and all your internal users should be able to access the public IP address of your website Is that not the case  When you use the FQDN of the website it will probably first always resolve to the local IP address Can you clarify your question  RVCE Right now in the local DNS Windows server I have an A record of wwwourdomaincom pointing to 192168105 and it works but if I change that record to our public IP or just try to type the public IP into the address bar it will not load the website from the inside When I type the public IP it asks me to log into the router through http Everything loads with the website out of the building Thanks for your assitance RVCE Hello ok understood Try and change the static NAT entry ip nat inside source static tcp 192168105 80 interface GigabitEthernet01 80 to ip nat inside source static tcp 192168105 80 xxxx 80 extendable where xxxx is the IP address of GigabitEthernet01 RVCE I tried that and still no luck I read somewhere that this isnt possible on my router but I do not know how accurate that is I have a Cisco 1921 IOS router It is still asking to login to the router through http when I try accesing the webpage using the public IP address RVCE Hello what is the public IP address of the web site  I want to try and see if I can access it from the outside RVCE I wet back to domainless NAT again to see if it would work with the extendable added and still no luck All interfaces no ip nat insideoutside ip nat enable on all ip nat source list 1 interface GigabitEthernet01 overload no ip nat insidce source list 1 GigabitEthernet01 overload ip nat source static tcp 192168105 80 hidden 80 extendable no ip nat inside source static tcp 192168105 80 hidden 80 extendable So on and so on RVCE Hello when I type in the IP address this is what I get httpsokcgcccom Can you try to change your NAT entry to use port 443 instead of 80  RVCE Yeah I have 443 in there as well Could having all 3 808080 and 443 be causing the issue RVCE Hello that could be an issue Try one port I can connect on 80 and 8080 both get me to httpsokcgcccom
Partial BGP routes in Cat 3650,Has anyone done BGP peering w an ISP and received prtial routes wo any problemsWere thinking to do this on a 3650 switch and werent sure if it has enough resources to hold the partial routesHow much memory does a route take3650 has 4GB of RAM on its datasheet which seems adequate but it also says its limited to 24000 IPv4 routes which is probably not enough TIA,Hello the Catalyst 3650 with IP Services has full BGP support Where did you see the 14000 route limit  For the full BGP table you need approximately 1GB so 4GB is plenty RVCE Thanks for the quick replyThe 24000 v4 route capacity was taken from the datasheethttpswwwciscocomcenusproductscollateralswitchescatalyst3650seriesswitchesdatasheetc78729449html Total number of IPv4 routes ARP plus learned routes24000DRAM4 GB RVCE Hello odd as in general the size of the routing table is limited only by memory Maybe they are referring to static routes  Either way full BGP support should mean full BGP routing table support RVCE Size of routing table is not limited only by memory Since 3650 is the swich the problem is that routes need also to be loaded into line cards IP cef otherwise CPU will not be able to keep up thats why there is limitation for number of routes RVCE Hi GeorgPredrag is right On switches the routing table what you see in show ip route actually has to be downloaded into the TCAM as all forwarding decisions are done using the data in the TCAM In switches TCAM is always a scarce and limited resource and is much smaller  in terms of the number of elements it can hold  than the amount of RAM This is where the limit for a maximum of 24K routes on a Catalyst 3650 comes from RAM can obviously hold many more routes but they wont all make it into the TCAMCatalyst 3650 is positioned as an access layer switch and that pretty much defines its intended use case It is possible to run full BGP in terms of all BGP bells and whistles you may be accustomed to but the switch wont be able to handle the full BGP table in its hardware If the datasheet specifies that the maximum number of routes is about 24K then that is the true limitation and is unlikely to ever be lifted as it is derived from the TCAM resources the switch has available Once again this is an access layer switch and 24K routes are a lofty reserve for an access switch positioning it as an edge router with either a partial or a full BGP feed might be stretching it beyond its limitsMy two centsBest regardsPeter RVCE Peter Pedrag good stuff thanks for that info I didnt know that That said I have never seen a 3650 switch on the edge of a large enough network to need the full BGP table Which warrants the question to the OP do you really need the full table RVCE Thank you all for your participation in this thread  didnt anticipate so many people helping out in such a short time period Minimal requirement is just to receive the default route from two ISPsWe never planned to receive full routes knowing a switching platform is not going to be powerful enough but was hoping to receive partial  customer routesOne of the ISPs said they had over 80000 routes just for partial so if the C3K is limited to only 24K then well just stick w defaultonly

Redistributed OSPF type 5 LSA not populating the routing table,Im currently taking routing updates from our SP for our new MPLS We currently have other circuits providing data services to the sites we are migrating to the new MPLS so already have entries via existing networks in OSPF via interarea routes When i allow the new routing updates through the MPLS filter list i have into our core OSPF process i cannot get the routing update to populate the routing table in the OSPF PID i have used to peer with our SP I have the type 5 LSA learnt via the new MPLS connection  multiple other routes for my remote sites however when i allow a prefix that matches an existing prefix learnt in the core ospf process the route will not push into the routing table Im currently testing with 10137700 25 but this failsIf my SP advertises 101377024 instead and i permit that through my filter list bear in mind i dont have a route to that network prefix already It works For context I can allow any other unknown route through the filter list  it populates the routing table on demand Is there a reason OSPF would prevent type 5 E2 LSAs populating the routing table if we already have an interarea route in the routing table Happy to provice scenario diagram if this helps Cheers Jack Solved Go to Solution,OSPF will always install the best path in routing table Intraarea route always preferred over inter and inter area over external Metriccost will come into play when you are comparing two prefixes within the same route type if you like I can configure a small lab in gns3 and share the results RVCE If I am understanding what Jack is asking then I believe that the key is when he asks for a resilient route I would assume that what he means is that if he loses the inter area he would like the external route to be in the routing table And that is exactly what should happen As long as the inter area route is in the table the external will not be in the table and when the inter area route is removed from the routing table then the external route should be put into the routing table HTH Rick RVCE Jack hard to say without seeing the configs Do you have bgp redistributeinternal configured  Post the full config of the router if possible RVCE Hi Georg So the BGP  redist is all done by the service provider router we actually only see OSPF from them  peer through that They are sending us

updates any differently than an ACLs logic Im just curious thats all as they seem to acheive the same goals but people do appear to sway towards routemaps i understand the much higher ability to control  influence the routestraffic using set statements etc however for a simply permitdeny action is there any difference in the logic Thanks for your assistance with this KR Jack RVCE HiThe following command is usually used when you are using VRF under your OSPF and I have seen that issue before with VRF it should be configured on the PE in order to check the down bit and I have not configured it on global routing unless your OSPF is under a VRF try to configure it on the CE or request it on the PE ISP siderouter ospf Xcapability vrflite RVCE Hi Julio Thanks very much for your reply By the time the routing update reaches us we are only routing in the global routing table The service providers router on our premesis is the last router using VRF on the MPLS If it was a VRF capability issue should i be able to receive any other routes or would this just affect the routing for routes already in the routing table KR Jack RVCE If you are learning the same prefix as a intra or inter area then external route would fail to install in global RIB RVCE cofee wroteIf you are learning the same prefix as a intra or inter area then external route would fail to install in global

the same route type if you like I can configure a small lab in gns3 and share the results RVCE Hi Cofee Thanks again for your input My question there would be although i have a type 3 route learnt from the inter area route within OSPF is there a way I can get OSPF to populate the external routes even if inferior to the existing routes as resilient routing alternatives in the global routing table KR Jack RVCE Is there a reason you want to install both routes in the RIB This is the solution I can think of a You will either need to redistribute the prefix thats being learned as an interarea and then use cost to install the desired route in RIB b This option is more compllicated as this would require help from mpls provider If the PE routers are in the same ospf domain under vrf to connect your sites  meaning same ospf process IDs on both side of the vpnv4 tunnel then all ospf redistributed prefixes will show up as an IA inter area routes because mpls cloud is considered to be super backbone In the end cost will be the deciding factor RVCE If I am understanding what Jack is asking then I believe that the key is when he asks for a resilient route I would assume that what he means is that if he loses the inter area he would like the external route to be in the routing table And that is exactly what should happen As long as the inter area route is in the table the external will not be in the table and when the inter area route is removed from the routing table then the external route should be put into the routing table HTH Rick RVCE Hi RichardCofee Richard you were correct in your understanding I was hoping to have this external resilient route available to put in the routing table for a graceful cut over to the new MPLS routes when ready But from what i can understand I cannot populate the global RIB with both external  internal routes simultaneously using OSPF Funnily enough i proved this last night by taking the internal routing update out  the external came straight into the routing table from the MPLS provider However when i re added the network statement to OSPF the E2 external route stayed in the routing table until i supressed the routing update from the external source using my filter list again This may just be a case of having to wait for the LSDB flood timeout to cleanse the old route but I didnt have too much time to test this Cofee My MPLS ipvpn is layer 3 to site then layer 2 1q subifs downlink to my switches so there is only BGP right up until the providers PE router in our DC I have seen the endtoend OSPF setup installed before now where the remote site is advertised using OSPF instead of BGP but as you say this would take significant time investment now from myself  the service provider Once again thanks for both your inputs much appreciated KR Jack RVCE Jack I am glad that out explanations were helpful Yes you should be able to have one or the other routing entry in the active routeing table but not both at the same time Thank you for marking this discussion as solved HTH Rick
Is a 10gig mm fiber connection backwards compatable to a 1gig mm fiber,I have a trunk that is partially getting consolidated and upgraded I only have the parts to upgrade half of the connection at this point Currently its two 1gbps SFP Fiber optic mm 850nm optics Can I upgrade the one side with two 10gbps SFP fiber optic mm 850nm optics since I have this gear now and the link would just work at 1gbps because the other side is 1 gig Solved Go to Solution,No the optics need to be the same on either side They use the same wavelength but need to operate at the same data rateHope this helps RVCE No the optics need to be the same on either side They use the same wavelength but need to operate at the same data rateHope this helps RVCE Ok thank you The issue is that I have an oppurtune time coming up where I can take a floor out of service and exchange two 4 SFP trays in 3750x switches with the NM10G module which has 2 SFP ports and 2 regular SFP ports Perhaps I will load the existing 1 gig sfps in the first slot on each switch and then load the 10 gig sfps in the last slot 4 Te2 on each switch Then in a month when the core is swapped out in the data room which will have 10 gig optics we just have to run up to that floor and move the patch cables RVCE Sounds like a plan If you have available fiber you could also have the 10G uplinks patched to the core location and just move the jumpers there Either way will work RVCE I dont have available fiber But I think I ran into another problem Upon closer inspection of the fiber cable that was put into the building years ago The outside jacket says 625125 multimode I subtracted the foot marking on this third floor switch closet end and the foot marking on the first floor data center end and I get a difference of 146 ft Thats 445 meters of OM1 cable To my understanding 10 gig is only certified up to 33 meters on OM1 cable I guess I can try it out but if it doesnt link up then I cant blame the optics or the switches Ill have to keep that link at two  1 gbps links RVCE Well it is a good thing you have done your home work Ill bet you get link it will just be prone to errors and I wouldnt want to rely on itIf you absolutely want 10G you could look into the SFP10GLRM and would possibly also need mode conditioning patchcords But if the Gig is sufficient that will probably be easiest and best httpwwwandovercgcomdatasheetsciscosfp10Gigabitpdf RVCE Ok well I did some testing this morning I created a new vlan 777 in the datacenter switch and a vlan 777 in this third floor switch stackI put Te311 on vlan 777 and also I picked a port Gi302 in this case on vlan 777 In the first floor I put Te712 in vlan 777 and also a port Gi802 in vlan 777I put a laptop off of each gigabit ethernet port manually IPd and did some SMB transfers from both machines Both laptops have SSD drives Although they are limited by the 1gig port they appear to have very respectable throughput upwards of 76MBsec for big files in the 30MBsec for smaller files and the one laptop is a Sony VAIO that is over 5 years old Im not seeing any errors at all Maybe we are good after all 3rd floorTenGigabitEthernet311 is

BGP Multihomed Prepend,Hi all Im planning to prepend my AS to my 2nd ISP like i have ISP1  100Mbps and ISP2  50Mbps so that my inbound traffic will come over to my ISP1 What if my ISP1 get congested will BGP behave to force other traffic to my ISP2 or should i left them to defaultno prepend Thanks all Solved Go to Solution,Understand what you want to achieve but I believe the answer will be it dependsWithout the prepending the question is is ISP1 preferred naturally is it evenly split or is even ISP2 preferredIf with prepending you force all traffic to prefer ISP1 then BGP will stay with that path regardless of the congestionSuggest checking for your ASnetblocks at various Looking Glass sites to determine how the Internet routes to you in its natural state You may be able to find the right amount of prepending that will allow for some sort of middle ground RVCE Understand what you want to achieve but I believe the answer will be it dependsWithout the prepending the question is is ISP1 preferred naturally is it evenly split or is even ISP2 preferredIf with prepending you force all traffic to prefer ISP1 then BGP will stay with that path regardless of the congestionSuggest checking for your ASnetblocks at various Looking Glass sites to determine how the Internet routes to you in its natural state You may be able to find the right amount of prepending that will allow for some sort of middle ground RVCE Do you think one of the best thing to do is to observe both upstream and then prepend one of them who received most of the traffic And also regarding local pref what if best path is isp2 but i chose to have higher local pref at isp1 will bgp router adjust it best path RVCE Yes it would probably be best to observe the traffic in its natural state and then adjust accordingly Prepend 1x then 2x if needed etc Mind you if the traffic is evenly distributed and no link is being staurated that may be the best state and not just based on the more or less traffic Also a single prepend could influence it to an all or nothing where only 1 ISP is used Again it depends BGP will choose the local preference over the best path RVCE Traditionally prepending if often an all or nothing deal although depending on whats your public IP allocation you can prepend differently for your public networksFor additional granularity you might be able to pass community strings to your ISPs and they can adjust how sending sources will see cost to your networksBoth of the above are static when it comes to load balancing PfR does have the capability to respond to ingress load and inform your ISPs PfR can also do outbound load balancing and this doesnt require any cooperation from your ISPs

How to control nameserver priority ,Id be surprised if there isnt a really simple solution but sofar I have not found itHow do I prioritise one ip nameserver entry over another Best I can figure they are prioritised in the order they are added to the config If I now attemp to resolve a FQDN you cant see it but the router pauses for 10 seconds as it attempts to resolve the FQDN using server 1111 which doesnt existThen it moves on to 8888 and immediately resolves it successfully A second ping is made to wwwcnncom this time the router only uses 8888 and immediately resolves the FQDN So the router can detect a failed nameserver and can remove it from its poolBut there does not seem to be a FailBack mechanism First lets reset our experiment Now lets give it these settings If I now try to resolve wwwgooglecom the same behaviour occurs I can now make 8844 accessible again by removing the bogus routeBut even though 8844 is now accessible the router is still only using 8888 for name resolution I let it sit there for maybe 30min to see if the failback has a long delay but sofar it is content ignoring 8844 for name resolution So whats the trick I need branch offices to use an internal DNS server over VPNMy solution seems overkill I wrote an SLA and a Tracking Object and an EEM I feel like Im forgetting something really basic,Hello DNS timeout is 3 seconds by default and the retry is 2 which amounts to about 10 seconds You can change that by configuring ip domain retry 0ip domain timeout 1 You can also configure ip domain roundrobin to change the search order to accomodate for load balancing RVCE Georg Pauwen wroteHelloDNS timeout is 3 seconds by default and the retry is 2 which amounts to about 10 seconds You can change that by configuringip domain retry 0ip domain timeout 1You can also configure ip domain roundrobin to change the search order to accomodate for load balancingHiEverything you say is of course correctBut Im looking for a tiny bit more controlI have some internalonly host names and some splitDNSSo for these the 1921681011 server will provide the correct answer while 8888 would notIf the VPN flutters I want my branch office to at least be able to use the internet using 8888 for DNSBut if the VPN comes back up I want my branch office to immediatly go back to using 1921681011 This could be easily achived if IOS allowed me to assign a priority to nameserversBut that does not appear to be a feature
Suppress and Unsuppress,Hi all i found a site where route aggregation is explained The config shows a 21 was created from the aggregated addresses after the command was executed the result was prefix that were suppressed was not advertised which is expected my question is what if i implement Unsuppress command instead of suppress with different approach it will yield same result right Thanks all,

your WAN IP address with any of those other addresses from the block that has been assigned to you That way you know the addresses are properly routed Any of them should establish connectivity with your ISP RVCE Hi Thanks Below my new settings its not working still Yes i have tried changing ip address also from 146 to 153 no luck  Is it possible to disable ARP completly to get NAT NVI to work

Can I Delay eBGP Peering,HelloIs it possible to delay an eBGP peering I have several sites with redundant ASR1006 routers that seem to take up 30 seconds to complete their GetVPN registration after a reload Since BGP becomes active placing the router in the forwarding path long before GetVPN registration is complete any traffic that attempts to traverse that linkrouter is dropped This also occurs at sites where the Key Servers are local and reachable via LAN connectivity As all sites have redundant routers a newly reloaded router would be able to reach a Key Server without depending upon the BGP routes being learned so I would like to find a way to delay the BGP peering reestablishment after it has been lost due to a circuit failure or router reload for 30  60 seconds to allow GetVPN registration to completeThanks,Hi I am not sure if you can alter the bgp phases from idle to established but you delay the routing advertisement neighbor xxxx advertisementinterval xx httpswwwciscocomcenustddocsiosiproutebgpcommandreferenceirgbookirgbgp3html HTH RVCE I dont know how to delay the relationship forming but you could increasing the BGP timers for it to take longer to declare a neighbour as dead RVCE Hello in addition to the other posts and I dont know if that is feasible in your particular situation you could use two EEM applets one that removes the eBGP neigbhor when the link is down and puts it back into the configuration when the link is up The second action is delayed by 30 seconds This would generically look like below in the example the event timer countdown is 30 seconds which means the eBGP neighbor will be added 30 seconds after the link has been up event manager applet removebgpevent syslog pattern LINK3UPDOWN Interface FastEthernet0 changed state to downaction 11 cli command enableaction 12 cli command config taction 13 cli command router bgp 1action 14 cli command no neighbor 19216812 remoteas 2action 15 cli command endaction 16 cli command wr mem event manager applet delaybgpevent syslog pattern LINK3UPDOWN Interface FastEthernet0 changed state to upaction 10 cli command event timer countdown time 30action 11 cli command enableaction 12 cli command config taction 13 cli command router bgp 1action 14 cli command neighbor 19216812 remoteas 2action 15 cli command endaction 16 cli command wr mem RVCE event manager applet delaybgpevent syslog pattern LINK3UPDOWN Interface FastEthernet0 changed state to upaction 14 cli command neighbor 19216812 remoteas 2 event manager applet removebgpevent syslog pattern LINK3UPDOWN Interface FastEthernet0 changed state to downaction 14 cli command no neighbor 19216812 remoteas 2 If you replace action 14s with no neighbot 19216812 shutdown and neighbor 19216812 shutdownthat this would be a safer way to do it since you dont lose any further manipulation of bGP on your peers such as activation routemaps filterlists etc best regards tim RVCE Thanks to everyone for the replies I am looking into the EEM script now but for some reason the delay function doesnt see to be working I need to test more but the EEM options seems like it might work for what I need to accomplish
Are both interfaces active on an EHWIC1GESFPCU,Looking to add an EHWIC1GESFPCU card to a Cisco 2901 router I am curious if both the SFP and the copper port are active as sepearte routeable interfaces or is it one or the other I would like to use the SFP port with a fiber mm optic cable but Im curious if I could also use the copper cat5e jack on this ehwic card as another interface for routing,HiSee below  For flexibility the EHWIC includes one SFP slot which supports a Cisco SFP and a copper RJ45 port where either the SFP port operating at 1001000 Mbps or the RJ45 operating at 101001000 Mbps port can be active at one time httpswwwciscocomcenusproductscollateralinterfacesmoduleshighspeedwaninterfacecardsdatasheetc78660124html RVCE Thank you It seems I need two cards IF I want an extra copper and extra fiber interface However I think I can make due with some spare things i have laying around Thanks for your answer

100 default Basically you are creating an SVI interface vlan for these networks and in order to be able to use it you must create the VLAN now this VLAN must be passing between a trunk interface between the switches used for HSRP For example for the VLAN 10 who has the subnet 1040139026 interface Vlan10  SVIip address 10401392 255255255192  IP address for the active HSRPstandby 10 ip 10401395

return be the active once the devices or SVI is up again Hope it is useful RVCE Hi BrijendraNo worries  Im happy to assist youOk about why there are many VLANs well the VLANs are used to separate traffic from subnets for example you can have a VLAN for IT Accounting HR Management Execute team etc This is a method to provide security limit the broadcast domains etcNow if you want to enable communication between VLANs you have to deploy a Layer 3 devices like a router multilayer switch or firewalls On your switch I can see several VLANs I think they are created for specific users a good practices is create a description for each VLAN you can use the command show vlan or show vlan brief to identify the VLANs created on the switchThere are VLANs created by default Vlan 1 10021005 These VLAN cannot be deleted but they can be disabled through SVI for example to disable the VLAN 1 And you must do that for security reasons you can executeinterface vlan 1shutdown Additional to be implemented for user subnets the VLANs can be used to enable a Layer 3 point to point between 2 multilayer switches and with that you can run routing protocols between them to know other subnets

link state vs distance vector,hello everybodyim sorry i do have a questionslink state and distance vector operates reletively the samehowever there are some diffrencesan i was wonder which algorithm is better forCPUl load traffic exchangeconvergence meaning less load less traffic and faster convergenceand why that isthank yousorry for the dumb question,HiSome routing protocols can be used for specific scenarios but link state protocols like OSPF and ISIS have very fast convergenceNow you must evaluate where you are going to implement a routing protocol the requeriments size of the networks etc Also there are routing protocols more complex than others OSPF is mostly implemented on large networks The link state routing protocols create a map of the network and they can determinate the path based the shortest cost to a destination Other protocol with fast convergence is EIGRP it is considered as hybrid protocol an advanced vector distance but it has characterists similar to link state protocols it does not create a complete map of the topology it send updates about changes when an event occurs only About RIP it has slow convergence and recommended for small networks All the routing protocols can generate CPU processing when they are learning networks and selecting the best path but it will not affect router performance unless something extraordinary is happening or any misconfiguration This link could be usefulhttpssupportforumsciscocomt5lanswitchingandroutingwhatdifferentbetweendistancevectorandlinkstateroutingtdp2900912 Hope it is useful  RVCE after some digging I found link state have relationships with connected peers whenever the topology changes it will send an updates immediately and more often whereas distance vector will send updates to the entire routing tableis that correct RVCE Hi That is correct for example RIP who is a vector distance sends the entire routing table to the neighbors RVCE Julio says that yes it is a characteristic of distance vector routing that it sends the entire table I disagree I agree that it is a characteristic of RIP and RIP is a distance vector protocol But entire table updates is how a particular DV protocol was implemented and not a characteristic of DV The original poster asks about speed of convergence This does not have a simple answer In some circumstances especially when there is a feasible successor EIGRP absolutely converges the fastest But without a feasible successor EIGRP convergence is not quite as fast and OSPF might converge more quickly In considering the convergence of OSPF we must bear in mind that when there is a change in the network that OSPF must run the convergence computation for all of the entries in the link state data base for that area So if the OSPF network has a single area and has lots of entries in the link state data base then the convergence will be slower because it has more computation to do while with few entries in the link state data base computation will be quicker What we can say about convergence is that both EIGRP and OSPF converge pretty quickly Convergence is not a particularly good criteria for choosing which protocol to use You also get sort of mixed results if you look at CPU processing If you consider that OSPF does do a refresh of the data base every 30 minutes and that when it runs the algorithm for a change in the network that it must process every individual entry in the link state data base for that area it would seem that the CPU load for OSPF is greater than the load for EIGRP But if you look at the CPU load to process the routing protocol and compare it to other things that impose VPU load the load generated from the routing protocol is generally not significant HTH Rick RVCE In considering the convergence of OSPF we must bear in mind that when there is a change in the network that OSPF must run the convergence computation for all of the entries in the link state data base for that area So if the OSPF network has a single area and has lots of entries in the link state data base then the convergence will be slower because it has more computation to do while with few entries in the link state data base computation will be quickerNB Later Cisco devices support ISPF which may greatly reduce the impact of a topology change computationWhat we can say about convergence is that both EIGRP and OSPF converge pretty quicklyNB To obtain very fast convergence as in subsecond of either EIGRP or OSPF often default timer parameters require reduction
BGP Active Status,Hi ExpertsI have bGP Active issue the BGP route is routed by portchannel i am wondering able to ping portchannel on both side but BGP is active,Could be any number of things Is it EBGP or IBGP  Have you tried turning on BGP debugging as that usually gives a good idea as to what is wrong Jon RVCE HiAs Jon mentioned you could execute a debug to see what is going on usually active state is representing the router is trying to establish a TCP session If it fails it will try again you could verify if the IP addressing configured on the neighbors are correctly Also you could execute show ip bgp neighbor neighbor it could show more information about the peering  RVCE It would be helpful if you would post the router config especially the part for router bgp and the output of the command show ip bgp and show ip bgp neighbor HTH Rick RVCE Hi Guys It is resolved due to firewall it was stucked up in active state RVCE Thank you for posting back to the forum to let us know that the problem is resolved and that the issue was with a firewall I am glad that you found the solution to your problem This might give other readers of the forum a place to look if they experience similar symptoms HTH Rick

DHCP Client Functionality on 7606S with RSP720,Hello I have a 7606S router with an RSP7203CGE supervisor and a 7600ES20GE3C card I thought Id make one of the ports on the RSP a routed port and connect to the internet and do NAT on this router but it seems there is no DHCP client functionality available on any of the images for the 7600 series is that correct My ISP provides ip addresses via DHCP only and Ive tried 1524S4a 1533S6 and 1553S5 but ip address dhcp doesn’t seem to be a valid command on any of them There are configif commands referencing dhcp client options but I get the feeling theyre for setting up the relay function Is there no way to get an ip address leased via DHCP on an ethernet interface on a 7600 router I understand that it was developed as an edge router but it just doesnt make sense to me that they would deliberately remove a feature from the service provider train Is there maybe a workaround using a local pool,
BGP conditional route injection issue,I will try to keep this as simple as possible Im configuring route injection at a site taking a 24 and injecting 32s Individual tunnel peerings with one 24 origin each has been successful The problem arises with the peering to our colocation facility This single peering is receiving all the 24 advertisements from the individualy peered sites This has failed Reasoning seems to be that once the first 24 in the configurations hits the routemap the route map stops processing there So the question is is there a way to do multiple 24 to 32 injects on one inject configuration Or do I have to do seperate injects for each 24 I receive from this tunnel peering Continue clause does bot work on the aggregated routemap I also tried doing one 108000 16 prefix but that didnt work as wellBasically it will process the first in the list 108069024 and stop there Any workarounds Thanks ip prefixlist COLOITSPFULL permit 108069024ip prefixlist COLOITSPFULL permit 108089024ip prefixlist COLOITSPFULL permit 108088024ip prefixlist COLOITSPFULL permit 108080024ip prefixlist COLOITSPFULL permit 108030024ip prefixlist COLOITSPFULL permit 1080223024 le 25ip prefixlist COLOITSPINJECT permit 1080691032ip prefixlist COLOITSPINJECT permit 1080891032ip prefixlist COLOITSPINJECT permit 1080891232ip prefixlist COLOITSPINJECT permit 1080891432ip prefixlist COLOITSPINJECT permit 1080891632ip prefixlist COLOITSPINJECT permit 1080891732ip prefixlist COLOITSPINJECT permit 1080891832ip prefixlist COLOITSPINJECT permit 1080891932ip prefixlist COLOITSPINJECT permit 1080881032ip prefixlist COLOITSPINJECT permit 1080881232ip prefixlist COLOITSPINJECT permit 1080801032ip prefixlist COLOITSPINJECT permit 1080801232ip prefixlist COLOITSPINJECT permit 1080801432ip prefixlist COLOITSPINJECT permit 1080801632ip prefixlist COLOITSPINJECT permit 10803014132ip prefixlist COLOITSPINJECT permit 10803014232ip prefixlist COLOITSPINJECT permit 10802232032 ip accesslist standard COLOSOURCEpermit host 109010018routemap COLOITSPAGGREGATED permit 10 match ip address prefixlist COLOITSPFULL match ip routesource COLOSOURCEroutemap COLOITSPSPECIFIC permit 15 set ip address prefixlist COLOITSPINJECTrouter bgp xxxxbgp injectmap COLOITSPSPECIFIC existmap COLOITSPAGGREGATED copy attributes Solved Go to Solution,Hello unless something has changed in this feature you can only specify one aggregate route in your existmap That is probably why it stops after the first line So yes you need one existmapinjectmap configs for each aggregate you cannot do it in a single one RVCE Hello unless something has changed in this feature you can only specify one aggregate route in your existmap That is probably why it stops after the first line So yes you need one existmapinjectmap configs for each aggregate you cannot do it in a single one RVCE OK thanks Just wanted to make sure there wasnt a workaround The good news is I did not have to do the full configs as I could pull prefixlists from the previous individual site peerings Just had to do a new aggragated routemap with a new source and a new existinject command in BGP configs Wasnt so bad Thanks again

Why in OSPF network type mismatch makes the advertising router unreachable,in OSPF if router is point to point and the other is broadcast routes can show in the database but not in table can anyone please help understand this behaviour why ospf doesnt like it Ref httpswwwciscocomcenussupportdocsipopenshortestpathfirstospf711226htmlanc5 Solved Go to Solution,Point to point and broadcast are two different network types and not compatible with each other For example ospf broadcast network type elect a DR and BDR where point to point ospf network type doesnt do that When a router that is neither a DR or BDR and identified as a DROTHER in the ospf broadcast network type use special multicast group called alldrrouters 224006 to flood LSAs only the DR and BDR listen for updates on this multicast address 224006 All spf router multicast group 224005 is also used but it has other functions it can be used by any ospf router in the broadcast network type to maintain and form adjancency and flood updates by DRBDR routers One last thing ospf routers using network broadcast type is that they only form 2 way relationship with routers that are neither DR or BDR OSPF routers that are using point to point network type dont use all DR routers multicast group RVCE Point to point and broadcast are two different network types and not compatible with each other For example ospf

broadcast type is that they only form 2 way relationship with routers that are neither DR or BDR OSPF routers that are using point to point network type dont use all DR routers multicast group RVCE Everything that cofee pointed out is correct but not the exact reason that the neighboring router is not reachable from a SPF point of view The neighboring routers if one is configured for broadcast and one for pointtopoint will actually form a complete adjacency with each other and completely synchonize their LSDBs The reason for this being the network type is not encoded into OSPF packets and does not have to match Even though a DROTHER router on a broadcast network normally sends LSUs to 224006 the DR the pointtopoint end will send them to 224005 all OSPF routers and the DR will still process these The DR would send LSUs to the 224005 group anyway so these are processed by the pointtopoint side Also because the router configured as pointtopoint will not set the DR address in its hellos it will never compete for the DR position and the broadcast router will always declare itself DR The reason the neighboring router and networks attached to that router actually end up being unreachable and not installed in the RIB is due to the discrepancy in the LSDB and SPF computation The following occurs when the routers exchange LSAs and become adjacent The broadcast router will create a router LSA that contains entries for all its directly attached networks including the mismatched link Because the link on its side is set to broadcast mode it will create an entry in the LSA for it as a transit network with its own interface address as the DR and router interface address This DR address in the LSA is a reference to the network LSA Here is an example OSPF Router with ID 2222 Process ID 1 Router Link States Area 0 LS age 1091Options No TOScapability DCLS Type Router LinksLink State ID 2222Advertising Router 2222LS Seq Number 80000003Checksum 0xC519Length 48Number of

Router address 10002Link Data Router Interface address 10002Number of TOS metrics 0TOS 0 Metrics 10 It will also create a network LSA as it is the DR on the link This network LSA will contain a list of the two attached routers RIDs along with a reference to the DR routers interface address in the LSID Below is an example OSPF Router with ID 2222 Process ID 1 Net Link States Area 0 Routing Bit Set

24Attached Router 2222Attached Router 1111 All good up to this point The problem occurs when the router configured for pointtopoint creates its router LSA This LSA will contain entries for all its directly attached networks including this link The problem is how this link is listed in the LSA Instead of being listed as a transit network it will be listed as connected to another router pointtopoint with the neighboring routers RID and interface address and another entry as a stub network including the link prefix Below is an example OSPF Router with ID 1111 Process ID 1 Router Link

0 Metrics 1 Now even though the two routers have full link state information when they go to compute SPF and rebuild the network from the LSDB the network will be partitioned on the link between the pointtopoint routers router LSA and the pseudonode network LSA Here is a diagram representation Psuedonode Transit Network To RID 1111 LSA Type 2 To RID 2222 R1 point to point IF 10001 DR 10002 IF

link between the pointtopoint node and the psuedonode network LSA in the SPF tree It has mismatched information one side points to a RID and interface address the other to a stub network and RID Realistically even my repesentation is flawed as from an SPF point of view the links wouldnt even look matched up between the psuedonode and pointtopoint router it would look like both have a link pointing to nowhere Also as a note not all network type mismatches will result in no connectivity The only mismatches that result in no connectivity are ones between those that create a network LSA elect a DR and those that do not As an example configuring one link for pointtomultipoint and one for pointtopoint works fine Same thing for between broadcast and nonbroadcast The only other mismatch that will cause issues possibly with connectivity are between pointtopoint and pointtomulitpoint or pointtomultipoint non broadcast with more than two neighbors This will cause repeated flapping between neighbors and control plane churning as when the pointtopoint end creates a new adjacency it will flush the old and bring the neighbor down because it is only allowed to have one neighbor on the link Hope that explains everything clearly RVCE Your analysis on how ospf will behave with these two different network types mentioned in the post is very comprehensive My post was more focused on the key points that differentiates one network from the other  but I should added that this may not be the only reason for the ospf design to fail Thanks for your time and effort
IWAN design questions,HelloId like to ask couple of questions regarding IWAN20PfRv3 designPetr,1 Dont know It doesnt matter as long as all devices have similar software versions 2 Yes you can terminate MPLS and Internet WAN connections on a single hub Just use two Tunnel interfaces 3 Havent done this in a long time but yes the same device can be a hub mc and a hub br at the same time If you have a massive network you would want separate a separate MC A nice and cheap way to get a separate MC is to use a low cost router like a Cisco 890 series It comes with advanced IP so has every feature enabled and comes with 512MB to 1GB of RAM depending on model so could cope with quite a large network Let me recommend the Cisco 891F in particular httpwwwciscocomcenusproductscollateralrouters800seriesroutersdatasheetc78519930html I frequently use 890 series for branch routers as well The 890 series can flat line a 100Mbs circuit with everything turned on My favourite branch routers are the 897 and 89124X the 89124X has a 24 port switch built into it with 8 of those ports being PoE RVCE Thanks Philip RVCE Hi Philip We just got a 891F router does it support PfR v3 it doesnt seem to take the Domain config command Regards Jie RVCE Which C890 series routers are supported as IWAN branch BRs The consensus is that most of the C89x routers can be used as spoke BRs Internally there are two different models 890A and 890B The 890B is the model that can be used for IWAN BR The following table lists current set of C89x series routers that can used as IWAN branch BRs C891FK9 C896VAK9 C897VAMWEK9 C897VAGWLTEGAEK9 C899GLTEGAK9 C89124XK9 C896VAGLTEGAK9 C897VAMK9 C897VAGLTELAK9 C899GLTEVZK9 C891FWAK9 C897VAGLTEGAK9 C899GLTENAK9 C891FWEK9 C897VAK9 C897VAMGLTEGAK9 C898EAK9 C899GLTESTK9 C897VAWAK9 C897VABK9 C898EAGLTEGAK9 C899GLTEJPK9 C892FSPK9 C897VAWEK9 C898EAGLTELAK9 C899GLTELAK9 C891FK9 does support Pfrv3 RVCE Thanks Gaurav after upgrading the IOS I can see that it does support PfRv3 Regards Jie RVCE Hi PhilipFor Q3 What if you have 3 BR in PfRv3 it is possible all of them be configured as MCBR If Not is it possible to configure at least two MCBR in HA with ip anycast Regards Naldo

Router interface  Total Output Drops,Can someone explain to me the reasons for the Total Output Drops counter incrementing when there are no other output errorsI understand there can be drops from congestion and we are using classbased queuing I am trying to determine if there is a problem with the ISP because we have two sites in two cities similar 10MB circuits bundled T1s using the same

volume thats gone through the port in total output traffic  I would work that out first to see if its an issue  there will nearly always be drops due to congestion spikes etc but if its less the 1 I wouldnt be worrying about it burst traffic can cause drops too  floods the buffer in split second over utilising it can cause drop counter to increase  certain apps by default operate in bursty nature

you dropped 4  which is not a lot for the volume of traffic gone through Make sure your qos priority queues are not dropping traffic  if your using priority command it may cause some drops in total output as it can starve other queues and police its own queue as well so configuration can sometimes be the cause with qos  but if your voice video queues are ok I wouldnt be worrying about it too much unless your noticing issues in the network itself Are you aware of all the applications running locally on your network and what way they send traffic some of them could be sending bursts adding to the problem You should not use flow control when qos is applied it can cause issues for qos personally I wouldnt be looking into anything less than 1 drop rate unless there is an actual issue seen but thats up to you RVCE Dears how are you doing Im good I have this problem tooSHOW RUN INTER GIG 01interface GigabitEthernet01 no ip address duplex auto speed 1000end SHOW INTER GIG

IP transit ACL best practise,AllNeed to get some validation on the belowIn summary our border routers dont have any filtering on but this needs tostart happening in a slow progression eg blocking our address space inbound etcI am proposing an ACL that is applied to our IP Transit interfaces and IX peering interfaces blocking internal accessAs we are a service provider I have many GRE tunnels etc coming into our network and l2tps even via out IP transit etc as we are a service provider I am concerned that by applying an ACL we will cause some impact to customer networksThe first lot is to protect our devices withi public IPs placed on our network devices Below is protecting tunnel equipment to allow host 1111 in and block the rest to teh tunnel equipment and permit every other trafficip accesslist extended ACLINBOUND1 permit ip host 1111 host 22222 permit esp host 1111 host 22223 permit gre host 1111 host 22224 deny ip any host 22225 deny esp any host 22226 deny gre any host 2222100000 permit ip any anyWill the above if placed on our border specifically the permit ip any any ensure that customers will not be impacted Eg if they have ESPGRE will it be permittedIs there anything else here that I need to consider Solved Go to Solution,Im pretty sure that GRE and ESP are considered subsets of IP just like TCP UDP and ICMP are In other words permit ip host 1111 host 2222 should allow GRE and ESP since theyre coming in as IP payloads Thus your rules 2 and 3 will probably never match any traffic and just waste time evaluating packets needlesslyYour final permit ip any any should prevent your filter from blocking any packet that rides an IPv4 packet because the rule explicitly permits the protocol as a whole regardless of payload type RVCE Im pretty sure that GRE and ESP are considered subsets of IP just like TCP UDP and ICMP are In other words permit ip host 1111 host 2222 should allow GRE and ESP since theyre coming in as IP payloads Thus your rules 2 and 3 will probably never match any traffic and just waste time evaluating packets needlesslyYour final permit ip any any should prevent your filter from blocking any packet that rides an IPv4 packet because the rule explicitly permits the protocol as a whole regardless of payload type RVCE Barry makes a good point that statement 1 in the ACL makes statements 2 and 3 superflous The same thing is true of statement 4 which makes statements 5 and 6 superflous The result of this ACL is that the only traffic that is allowed to get to host 2222 is traffic sourced from 1111 And any traffic sourced from 1111 is allowed it could be RDP or SSH or TFTP or anything If that is what you intend then the ACL works and does not impact any other traffic other than anything with a destination of 2222 HTH Rick RVCE Hi thanks for both of your replies The aim is to start to clamp down on the environment and in this case I want to allow traffic from known sources to terminate vpn tunnels behind our border routers everything else to be blocked at the border By allowing this ACL Ill remove the ESPgre I think we are covered Any other suggestions

2901 router configuration,I was trying to reset my password so I followed your steps here httpssupportforumsciscocomt5networkinfrastructuredocumentsresettingroutertofactorydefaultremovingthestartuptap3131114 but I lost all configurations and even when I configure it back it didnt work probablyand I lost also IP telephones registration but after more search I found this httpswwwciscocomcenussupportdocsrouters2600seriesmultiserviceplatforms22188pswdrec2600html how to solve this issue ,If you did what I think you set the routers configuration to the factory default With password recovery you set the config register to 0x2142 and then reboot the router It will reboot with the factory default config but the actual config is still in NVRAM In this mode you are supposed to copy start run which loads the actual configuration You are still logged into the router and at this point and can change the password Once youve done that you then copy run start which saves the configuration to NVRAM with the new password then change the config register back to 0x2102 and you are doneThe fact that you changed the config register to 0x2142 rebooted the router and then did a copy run start meant that you copied the default config into NVRAM thus over writing the actua working config Heres the password recovery procedurehttpswwwciscocomcenussupportdocsrouters2800seriesintegratedservicesrouters112033c2900passwordrecovery00html RVCE Thanks for your reply I think that I did this warning command so my question is If I make factory setting from GUI In that case did I erased any component or software that previously installed like CME for IP telephones or any license for that telephones

GRE tunnels Failover with SLA,Hi everybodyI have these two routers using a GREIPSec Tunnel Within this tunnel the routers use EIGRP to publish the networks from one site to another Everything work fine right now but the customer has bought a new internet channel for one of the sites with another ISP and want to keep the current ISP as a Primary link and the new one as the Failover connectionThe topology will be like thisWhere the current tunnel is using the Public IPs 1010101 and 2020201I need to know if I can configure a tunnel between the 1010101 and the new 3030301 that only will work if the primary internet connection fails using SLA or something like that Please keep in minde the EIGRP routing protocolRegardsJose,Just bring both tunnels up and use the EIGRP metrics to choose one path primary and the other secondaryIdeally using the delay metric is the most recommended option Apply a worst delay on the tunnel interface for the secondary trafficRegardsEdison RVCE Hello EdisonAgree with everything just one small remark using the worst delay would probably make the route appear as unreachable to EIGRP Such a route would be ignored totally The delay should definitely be increased but not so much that there is no space for it to increase furtherBest regardsPeter RVCE I dont know much about EIGRP just the basics do you have any documentation about the model you propose This is the current configuration of the tunnelSite Ainterface Tunnel8 description GREIPSEC tunnel to Miami New Office bandwidth 384 ip address 17220130 255255255252 no ip routecache no ip

actual Public IPs for the routerHow should I configure the EIGRPThanks and RegardsJose RVCE Ive noticed you are using bandwidth statements under the GRE tunnels We can use the same metric on the new tunnel but with a value of 256kps which is a less preferred metricAs far as EIGRP configuration all you need are the GRE IPs under the EIGRP process as network statements RVCE Hi EdinsonThanks for your relpy Now Im facing a new challenge The current tunnel is encrypted using IPSec the new tunnel has to be encrypted too So the problem comes when I try to set up the ISAKMP preshared key in the site with the dual ISP connection The Site A single IPS connection has no troubles at all because I have to configure a new preshared key for each Public IP at the Site B but at the Site B dual ISP connections cannot configure the second ISAKMP preshared key because there is already a preshared key configured for the IP 1010101 as belowcrypto isakmp key anykey address 1010101A preshared key for address mask 1010101 255255255255 already existsI know I have to use the same IPSec cryptomap for both tunnels using a different instance within the same Cryptomap But can I use the same ISAKMP preshared keywhat should I do hereTahnks in advanceJose Manuel Cortes RVCE Hello JoseThere should be no problems with using the same IPsec key The key is not instantiated in some way that would prevent it from being shared among many tunnels You are simply creating two security associations with the host 1010101  but it is the same host so the key has to stay the same regardless of how many tunnels are created towards itBest regardsPeter RVCE How will we configure default route in this scenario How will we set the Gateway with respect to 2 different Service provider Please suggest RVCE How is your default route currently configured In most instances where there is a GREIPsec tunnel to a remote site the default route is configured at the head end and is advertised by EIGRP to the remote end In that case there is no difference and no change required when a second tunnel is brought up for the remote end EIGRP is running over both tunnels and is advertising the default route over both tunnels and the remote end will choose the default route with the better metric The fact that there are two ISP has no impact on this HTH Rick RVCE Peter you are correct I shouldve said worse delay than the current default delay on the primary link RVCE I am looking at doing something similar and would it make much difference as I am using BGP routing  RVCE You are running BGP over the GREIPsec tunnel Obviously the way that you manipulate routing protocol parameters to have one as primary and the other as backupfailover would be different Other than that there should be no impact on how you configure and manage the tunnels HTH Rick

Can you please tell me what chnages i have to make in my router so that when i change link to relince then communication start with data centre RVCE You need to have those routes i posted in last note at least as there the working routes on vodafone  i changed the gateway to reliance so they should work but they are set with higher AD thand teh VDF routes  you should use something like ip sla with it to track the vodafone link interface and then have a failover to the reliance link you havent provided what subnet you DC is on RVCE You are expecting us to guess what your network looks like Can you provide a quick diagram with the relevant IPs so we can understand what you are trying to do Jon RVCE hi john thanks i problem is that whenver i chnage the route to relince my communication stop that is my problem We use static Route for conecting with my data centre But as we chnage the link to relince all communication stop regardsBrijendra RVCE Hi thats because there are no static links pointing to the reliance gateway ip address in the config provided apart from 1 host route  one of the links should be primary  one should be backup if just using statics unless your trying to achieve some form of load balancing if so BGP would be better choice if possible  if primary and backup i would advise using ip sla with tracking too for failover  we can assist with that config too its useful to have in place if you need it The routes i posted earlier should work if you test but the Vodafone link needs to be admin down or disconnected as there weighted higher than the current statics that are in the routing table for the VDF path so will only come into effect when the VDF is down RVCE ok mark i will test the same twomaarow and let you know
iBGP routes  MPLS question,Im playing around with MPLS in the lab to get some handson time with the technologyI set up a basic ABC router chain with B as the Prouter with AC peering via iBGP and learning eBGP routes from two more test routers ABC use OSPF as the IGP and B has no BGP whatsoever If LDP is down whenever A learns a route then router C only attempts to forward via IP and not the MPLS path When LDP is restored the two routers do not add the LSP into the CEF table If I clear eBGP on A or iBGP on either A or C then when the paths are relearned the MPLS path is used it shows as a labelnext hopinterface in the CEF table This is also true if I break LDP and then restore it wo any BGP topology changesI assume that Im missing something simple here Why isnt the label taking over on its own when it becomes available Sample output when things are working 10133 is the IP address of router BHeres the output with MPLS broken EDITOne more detail is that when I restore LDP the show ip CEF output looks the same as when things are working properly except that a new label may have been chosen Wireshark confirms that router A is transmitting packets wo the label until I bounce either iBGP between A and C or else the eBGP source of the route that would follow this path,How long did you wait after LDP sessions are restored is it possible that you didnt wait long enough before LDP could reconverge and rebuild labels RVCE forgot to ask how did you break LDP session RVCE On router B I issue the command no mpls ipI dont check for the use of MPLS until after both routers A  C show LDP neighbor upAfter waiting about 30 seconds or so I am able to show mpls ip binding 1022000 24 and it is in the list with a label However even waiting a minute or two doesnt help RVCE I didnt experience this issue in my lab If you can share the topology and configuaration I can test in the lab RVCE If its a gns file then you can just send me the gns file RVCE I uploaded the exported file to Dropboxhttpswwwdropboxcomsi995bvfzpx7hf9impls20issuezipdl0 Thanks for taking a look RVCE I think this could be a bug with your code because the format I think its a little old you can see my config

Main BGP route and second static route,Hello guysI am testing righ now the hybrid network on one of my branchesFor exemple i have on the branch 1921681024 Main accès On MPLS Operator A 2nd accès Standby link over VPN IPsec InternetWhen the main access is down on the branch 1921681024 the access is switched to the 2nd access IPSec and it is working good On my router on data center i have 2 IP route to access the branch 1921681024 1st route BGP route learned from Operator A MPLS1921681024 200 via 10295220 2nd route Static route added manually with a higher metric 251921681024 250 via 10295230Consequently on the datacenter router the 2nd route becomes actif only when the main access is down and the 1st route no more broadcasted by the operator A to my data center router However when the main access is established again i am not able to retrieve my first BGP route broadcasted by the operator A1921681024 200 via 10295220 The 1st route come back again only when i delete my 2nd route manually from the router which is very strange beacause i would like to automated this part Did i miss something in my router configuration Thank you for you help and advicesBassel,HiI think you could configure fallover on the BGP peering RVCE all what i want is to priorise the BGP route in face of secondary static route when the MPLS access is restablished i dont know very well the fall over on BGP but i will take a lookThank you RVCE Are you redistributing static into BGP on your DC router  Jon RVCE Yes off course the static route is redistributed to the operator through BGP to permit trafic between branchs Should i change something here  RVCE It is to do with weight and the higher the weight the more preferred the route Routes received from an EBGP peer have a weight of 0 whereas locally generated routes have a weight of 32768 The static is redistributed into BGP and gets a weight of 32768 When the the branch comes back up and advertises the BGP route the DC gets it but it has a weight of 0 which means the DC router prefers the redistributed static Usual way way to fix this is to make the weight of the received routes from the MPLS PE device  32768 Jon RVCE so if i understand a change should be done on the operator side on the PE MPLS in order to change the weight of the sended BGP routesRight now all my recieved BGP routes on my DC router look like thisB 102639024 200 via 10295220 4w5dB 102640024 200 via 10295220 1w0dWith 0 as default weight no  RVCE You need to do a sh ip bgp to see the weight and it is a change you make on your router not on the PE device Jon
Static TCP NAT rule causing issues when routing from internal VPN,A bit of a curly oneI have a small network of routers that are all connected back to a single site via a cryptomap and matching subnets in ACLsIn addition I have an inbound static TCP NAT rule on the same inbound interface to a host on the internal LAN on the main router that all sites VPNs terminate back toip nat inside source static tcp 19216801 499 interface GigabitEthernet02 499This works fine ie if I go to the IP of Gi02 on port 499 from the general internet it worksThe problem comes from other sites The other sites all use subnets in 192168xx and are using IPSEC via a cryptomap on each interface back to this router The destination is the IP address for Gi02 on the main router The IPSEC has been up and running for some time working fine From a remote site I can ping 19216801 I can connect to any other port but if I try to connect to port 499 it times outAll other sites have NAT disabled when trying to access 1921680024 on the main router so it should not be hitting the static NAT rule from Gi02 to the internal host I have tried a few different ACLroutemap configs on the main router to attempt to force anything originating from another site to not NAT to TCP 499 on that host but it hasnt workedHas anyone seen something like this before Quite urgent to fix this Solved Go to Solution,Thanks Jon

Port 499 is now accessible from the outside world via the NAT to internal and from other networks on the IPSEC mesh also appear to be working At least telneting from source interfaces on the remote routers Will have to get the customer to check locally but think youve saved the day  Thanks a heap Just out of interest im assuming the counters wont increment on the routemap when used in a nat capacity sh routemap shows 0 packetsbytes on both RVCE Didnt check the counters to be honest so would have to setup the lab again but they dont always increment if I remember correctly Glad to hear it seems like it is working Jon RVCE Talk about rotten timing with the forum migrationDid you have any suggestions Jon or anyone else I figured the config posted should be working RVCE Yes not the best timing  Looks to me like it should work so if I get the chance tomorrow Ill knock up a quick lab and have a look I cant do the IPSEC part but that shouldnt matter it is really the NAT from two different places that needs testing hopefully get back to you tomorrow Jon
BGP neighbor command,hi guys Who will prevail regarding these neighbor commands i just dont understand why are these configurations enabled on the router neighbor 19216812 prefixlist MyASISP1 outneighbor 19216812 filterlist 2 out ip aspath accesslist 2 permit   this command advertise routes local to my AS ip prefixlist MyASISP1 description Prefix Advertise to ISP1ip prefixlist MyASISP1 seq 100 permit 00000 le 32  this command advertise routes with prefix length less than 32 Need your inputs these configs were already configured before i taken the network administration in my company and im planning to clean up the config since we will be migrating to new Core router,sh ip bgp neighbor 19216812 advertisedroutes will show you what is being advertised Jon RVCE HiThis ASPath list ip aspath accesslist 2 permit  is preventing your router become a transit router in other words it will not allow that all the Internet traffic is passing through your router RVCE so you mean my router will only advertise routes local to my AS thus preventing other routesnot local to be advertised right then do i still need these neighbor commands if i only allow routes local to my AS i think these will only help if have longer and shorter prefix to filtered right like if i have 4 24 and their 22 i can make my ip prefix list le 22 or le 24 neighbor 19216812 prefixlist MyASISP1 outip prefixlist MyASISP1 description Prefix Advertise to ISP1ip prefixlist MyASISP1 seq 100 permit 00000 le 32 RVCE HiThat is correct it will advertise the local routes only now it usually is configured when you have 2 ISPs a multihomed scheme
Weird Traceroutes,Hello allHoping someone can provide some suggestions on tshooting an issue im seeing in my networkSome configuration insight my gateway 17216010 is a router that also has 10101019226 configured on another interface 101010253 There is another router on this subnet on 101010252 and a switch the destination in question 101010242When doing a traceroute to the switch on 101010242 i get the following result1 17216010 gateway2 1010102523 1010102534 1010102525 1010102536 1010102527 1010102538 1010102529 10101025310 101010242So eventually it does reach the destination but it bounces between the two routers multiple times first So far I cant figure out why  on my default gateway the best route to 101010242 is via connected and all devices have proxy arp disabled So i cant see any reason for the traffic bouncing like thisAny one come across this before or able to offer a tshooting suggestion i have missedThanks,This is a pretty strange issue and I am not sure that I have seen this particular thing before It would help if you could post a diagram that clarifies the topology of the network To get things started here are a few questions and suggestions  can you clarify whether this is happening with real routers and switches or is done on some simulator  what type of router is your gateway and what type of router is the router that is connected to the gateway  what type of connection is between the two routers Is it a router physical Ethernet interface a switch routed interface or a switch vlan access port  you tell us that your gateway router has another interface 101010253 and on this network is a router 101010252 and a switch 101010242 Does the switch physically connect to the gateway to the other router or to both  before you start this traceroute are there entries in the arp table on the gateway for 101010252 and 101010242 And a similar question about whether the second router has arp entries for 101010253 and 101010242  it might be helpful to run debug arp on both routers run the traceroute and look to see if any arp activity is generated HTH Rick RVCE Hi Rick Thanks for the reply ive attached a topology Where Switches 123  4 are concerned the VLAN for the 10101019226 network is tagged traffic and passes at a L2 level  can you clarify whether this is happening with real routers and switches or is done on some simulator This is a live network not a simulated one  what type of router is your gateway and what type of router is the router that is connected to the gateway The gateway is a Cisco ASR1001X as is Router2 in the topology  what type of connection is between the two routers Is it a router physical Ethernet interface a switch routed interface or a switch vlan access port As per the topology each router goes in to a switch on trunk ports tagged for the specific VLAN They communicate between a switch ring of 10Gb fibres that is controlled by STP to prevent loops STP has been checked and an interface is disabled correctly  you tell us that your gateway router has another interface 101010253 and on this network is a router 101010252 and a switch 101010242 Does the switch physically connect to the gateway to the other router or to both As per topology via switches  before you start this traceroute are there entries in the arp table on the gateway for 101010252 and 101010242 And a similar question about whether the second router has arp entries for 101010253 and 101010242 Yes there are ARP entries already and the MACs correspond to the devices owning those IPs Have also tried an ARPCache clear to get them to relearn For reference switches 14 are HP Procurves and the switch that has 101010242 configured is a HP Comware switch All have STP configured A traceroute to 101010252 does not result in the same thing and appears to route correctly It shows 1 17216010 2 101010252 Thanks Colin RVCE Colin Thanks for the additional information Given the drawing showing the topology I am surprised that the router at 101010252 shows up in the traceroute at all So it raises some more questions Do any of the switches have layer 3 routing enabled Or are they all acting as layer 2 switches Given the fact that the first router has an interface in the subnet where the destination is located and that it does have an arp entry which has the correct mac address I would expect this to be the behavior  the router would build the first traceroute packet as a unicast frame with a destination mac address of the switch at 101010242 and transmit the frame on its Ethernet interface  the first switch would receive the unicast frame look for the destination mac address in its switching table and forward the frame to the next switch  the next switch would repeat those steps receiving a unicast frame look for the destination mac address in its switching table and forward the frame to the destination switch  note that in this behavior there is no reason why the router at 101010253 should process the traceroute frame or send a response to it Since the observed behavior is different we need to evaluate reasons why the switch is forwarding the frame not as a unicast frame with a known destination mac address but as some other type of frame most likely as a broadcast  is there some reason why the router is not sending the frame as unicast Perhaps a packet capture could verify the addressing of the frame that the router is sending Perhaps seeing the configuration of the router might shed some light on this  is there some reason why the switch is applying some type of layer 3 forwarding logic rather than the simple layer 2 forwarding of a frame with a known destination mac address  is there some reason why the switch would not have the destination mac address in its switching table resulting in flooding of the frame to all interfaces in the vlan HTH Rick RVCE Hi Rick Thanks for the additional response After spending a large amount of time tshooting getting captures etc and finding absolutely no rhyme or reason I arranged a maintenance window and tore down my entire config and rebuilt it with no topology or firmware changes at all Issue went away Most bizarre but glad it seems to be resolved Thanks for the detailed replies to assist much appreciated Colin RVCE Colin thanks for the update Glad to know that you got it working by starting over and rebuilding the configs with no changes made Looks like something was hung or out of sync somehow and rebuilding configs got it straightened out HTH Rick
python logon to devices and collect data,I have to build script so that it will logon to all devices in our network and collect show inventory show ip int bri and copy it in the csv file is there any easy way to do it using python or any other language I am new to automation,Easy is very subjectiveIve used both PERL and Python scripts from a Win 7 host to access Cisco devices interactively The former via telnet the latter via telnet or SSHWith the telnet packages in CPAN I found telnet access using PERL rather simpleWith Python I used v36 which limits packages you might find compared to using v27 and also supporting SSH further limited available packages So I ended up using a command line version of PuTTY and invoked it from my Python script The major issue then was interacting with the PuTTY program and not waiting on the command line PuTTY program to close after sending it its first command How to do this under Windows isnt well documented as most doing this kind of scripting would be running from a Linux hostIve also used PERL to query Cisco devices via SMTP which seems to run much faster than interacting with the device using telnet RVCE Hi im jst looking to see if i have an EEM script that will help you get all the commands but for now this will get your running config sorted and sent to either flash or to an external server every day to start with very stable feature archive path flashArchivecfg maximum 2 writememory timeperiod 1440 or to tftp server archive path tftp put your url here maximum 2 writememory timeperiod 1440 you can also send it using other

Write archive on https file system pram Write archive on pram file system rcp Write archive on rcp file system scp Write archive on scp file system tftp Write archive on tftp file system RVCE I dont know Python well so Joe maybe be able to help with that bit but heres an eem should work too  its basically logging in every 12 hours runs your commands and you can send it to email server then  you can add in more lines just add new actions  leave the amil server though as last section  tweak it to what you need addresses and email servers event manager applet CollectInfo event snmp oid

anything filled in  you can tweak this yourself test it action 50 mail server emailserver to emailto from emailfrom subject  RVCE If you want to use Perl then use the NetSSHCisco module although like Joe I only used Perl for telnet If you want to use Python then the Netmiko module will do the job assuming SSH To be honest as long as you understand the basics of programming the hardest part is usually installing the specific modules because neither of the above come with the standard distributions and depending on your OS you can often get incompatible libraries etc but assuming you can then there are any number of tutorials you can search for that should get you started I am currently getting up to speed with Python as that seems to be the scripting language of choice for network automation Jon RVCE Ive used the nonCisco variant of the telnet package  didnt find it much of a limitation when accessing Cisco devices in my environment were both Cisco and brand JYea Python is the new scripting darling for automation It has some features I like over PERL I also prefer the 3x train but that does exclude all the Python packages that dont yet support it RVCE Hi thereIve been playing with Python for a few months now mainly with APICEM automation This script below is a reworking of one I wrote to send config command to switcheshttpsgithubcomsebrupiksrupikapicemtoolsblobmasterfrozenPonysrconeLinerpy It doesnt make sense to save the output of sh inv and sh ip int br as the columns would be widly different Instead run

How  to perform path manipulation by using SuppressMap ,Anyboy can tell how to perform Path Manipulation By Using SuppressMap whosoever will reply please try to reply with an example because im so confused,R1 is in AS 100 and peers with R2 in AS 200 and R3 in AS 300 R1 is advertising subnets  19216800  19216870 all 24s and it does this  1921680022 and 1921684022 to R2 and 1921680021 to R3 so all traffic comes in via R2 because they are the more specific routes Now suppose you wanted all traffic for 1921683024 to come in from R3 instead You could still advertise the summary of 1921680021 without the summaryonly keyword but also use a suppress map to make sure only the summary and the 1921683024 subnet is advertised Jon RVCE I want to use suppress Map for Path Manipulation alongwith Loadbalancing but its not working properlyAnd as you are saying if we go with that then it will forward the traffic on the basis of Longest prefix match then also it is not going to perform loadbalancing even N WLLA OMNI are same for best path selection RVCE The example I gave was just that ie an example and you did not mention load balancing between links Considering supress maps are to do with summary routes and more specific routes within those summaries it is not necessarily the best choice for what you are trying to do Jon RVCE Hello Please consider first when you create a summary and use a suppress map those more general usually routes will contain components to that route but those in the suppress map are not advertised httpswwwciscocomcenussupportdocsipbordergatewayprotocolbgp5441aggregationhtml Regarding influencing routing a more specific rotue will be preffered always thants the way to implement route selection with less attention of course CCIE 52804

Cisco 4331 performance query,Hi communityI was looking for some information regarding how the performance of a 4331 would be impacted by enabling features of iWAN in addition to basic router functionality Ive read the Miercom report but this doesnt consider the scenario we will be implementing We will be enabling IPv4 forwarding ZBF DMVPN AVC PfR QoS NATIn the Miercom report it suggests with the performance license installed and the router running IPSec ZBF NAT QoS it can achieve 240Mbps 97 utilisation I obviously dont want to run the router this hard but wondered if anybody had implemented similar featuresservices and could comment on the impact on performance with such features enabled Id like to understand this more as we have a requirement for this router to support between 150200Mbps aggregated throughput with these services enabled As we also have a requirement to support a ESM slot the next step up for us would be the 4451 Id like to avoid this if possibleAny advice or links to other performance related literature would be much appreciated,Hi I run IWAN on 4331s with BGP and DMVON  and PFR with QOS utiliising live action too as tool for the IWAN monitoring I dont use ZBF on them as we have core PAs at our central sites where the HUB border and Master  these are ASRs But all our remote sites use 4331s as bordermaster IWAN BGPDMVPNPFR setup Our largest circuit we ahve in the 4331s though our 50mb each way We dont see any utilization issues at all running but we have hit some major bugs in PKI and IWAN since deploymenrt but its become more stable  wwe also kept our underlay in tact our old BGP network setup and built the IWAN directly over it so if the IWEAN collapses as we dont hold every faith in new tech it will auto revert to the OLD BGP setup keeping site up and running with stanrd BGP activestandby setup for primary and backup while the IWAN whnen fully up gives uus actioveactive routing based on QOS DSCP and policy mapping The 4431 is poiwerful router i think its fine for remote sites but fi this is your core mabe thinlk of the ASR 1001x too  we also run on the primary 4331 border remotes full voice services with 64 and 32 PVDM chips and it handles that fine too for video conferences etc Ive attached a good doc on 4000s and ASRs i found when we were researching for IWAN got some good details regarding hardware I ahvent seen of any of roiuters pushed hard yet and some of our sites are engineering sites where there hammering data through the routers to backup servers around the globe If you havent worked on IWAN and are fully changing your network you should speak to some professional services team that can give you some pointers as there are pitfalls in design depending on your current networks and definitly certain iosxe version are better than others and more stable Ther is memallocation fixes in 1553S6 whch is important as the PFR and DMVPN flapping causes the bug to leak and takes down the router this caused us too outages so pick you version welll  we moved off another one due to cosat PKI server cert failures too  that was earlier 4b version

transferring IP SLA config on 3750 Metro to 4451,Im replacing our 2 3750Metro Switches at our HQ and DR Sites with 2 4451 ISRs We have 3 remote sites that have 4451 Routers already Were using IP SLA to ping the routers on the other side of the VPLS links Trying to set a timeout of 2000ms on the 4451 and I get a error saying that its less than the threshold of 5000ms The 3750 doesnt have a threshold set so I was wondering what the default threshold is on a 3750 Metro since the router has one of 5000ms I can get by the issue by setting a threshold of 1000ms on the 4451 router but just trying to figure out what the default is on the 3750 switch Config on 3750 Metro Switchip sla 101 icmpecho XXXXXXXXXXXX timeout 2000 frequency 3ip sla schedule 101 life forever starttime now Attempted Config on replacement 4451 RouterROUTERconf tEnter configuration commands one per line End with CNTLZROUTERconfigip sla 105ROUTERconfigipslaicmpecho XXXXXXXXXXXXROUTERconfigipslaechotimeout 2000Error timeout is less than threshold 5000 Solved Go to Solution,Hello the default threshold on the 3750 is 5000 milliseconds You can see the treshold by entering show ip sla configuration x where x is the number of your configured SLA RVCE Hello the default threshold on the 3750 is 5000 milliseconds You can see the treshold by entering show ip sla configuration x where x is the number of your configured SLA RVCE Thanks Im able to see that now Why wont the router let you enter a timeout thats less than the threshold if the switch does RVCE To be honest I dont know XE is supposed to be an improvement I can imagine there is an interdependency of those two values RVCE Hello Why wont the router let you enter a timeout thats less than the threshold if the switch doesGeorg Pauwen wroteTo be honest I dont know XE is supposed to be an improvement I can imagine there is an interdependency of those two valuesIts because if you have a threshold value higher than the timeout vlaue As the timeout is an abosolute value and that its reached sla failure will occur And as the threshold is a value that should be reached BEFORE the timeout so an action an event can take placeIn your case you were trying to say every 5 seconds send a icmp message and if no reply is received within 2 seconds faill SLA however if the threshold exceeds 5 seconds report a exceed action but this would never be reached due to the lower timeout valueI am assuming in this case for the 3750 cisco is negating you even trying to decrease the thresholdresPaul Please dont forget to rate any posts that have been helpfulThanks
IWAN  Hub Master and Border on Same Router ,HiFrom the documentation it is stated that the HUB master should be on a separate router from the border My question is whether the setup with the master and border on the same router will workAlso in the current iwan version 21 can I have multiple transports ie multiple MPLS connections on the same border router and setup pfr across these links Solved Go to Solution,Hello Configuration on HubMCHubBR on the same box is not recommended because of scalability limitation Also it has not been tested but you may try and face an issue one day Two colours WAN tunnels must not be terminated on a single Hub BR in iWAN 20 21 211 Its in roadmap for 22 expected autumn 2016 RVCE Hello iWAN 22 is targeted for the March 2017 RVCE Hello Configuration on HubMCHubBR on the same box is not recommended because of scalability limitation Also it has not been tested but you may try and face an issue one day Two colours WAN tunnels must not be terminated on a single Hub BR in iWAN 20 21 211 Its in roadmap for 22 expected autumn 2016 RVCE Thanks Vasilii Just as a follow up say in a scenario you have two border routers connected to a WAN aggregation switch does the Master controller influence how the Border routers advertise the routes to the WAN aggregation switch in order for switch to forward traffic to the correct border router RVCE Hello Its not the case with PFRv3 In PFRv3 if traffic arrives from LAN at wrong BR its tunnelled to another BR RVCE Hi Thanks for the clarification We have a setup with two border routers each terminating MPLS connections from our six different service providers Each branch has MPLS connections for any two of the service providers based on the presence of the Service provider at at the branch location We have 4 DMVPN tunnels at each branch  two on SP 1 to BR1 and BR2 and two on SP 2 to BR1 and BR2 I have uploaded the diagram Do you have any idea of how I can do the Pfrv3 setup given the limitation of one transport SP per Border Router at the Hub site RVCE Hello Sounds like you have 6 DMVPN clouds So every DMVPN cloud on Hub should be a coloured interface   so you need six Hub BR devices because you may terminate only one tunnel per Hub BR As an option you may put extra routing layer between PFR BRs and clouds  but this would complicate the design a lot and may make PFR completely useless RVCE Hi vasil I have exactly same case What happen if i using 1 hub router for multiple transport mpls I already tested in my lab environment its works The next step i will implement iwan in production but i am become worry after read this page RVCE Hello Its not supported and you may have any kind of problems on the BR as a result The plan is to add multiple WAN interface support for iWAN 22 that will be available around September 2016 RVCE Hello I communicated with the Cisco PDT team Version 22 is not released yet They are saying tentatively end of October RVCE Hello I think this information is not precise Ive heard that updated information should be published soon 12 weeks from now RVCE Hi Are you aware of any progress as far as the IWAN version 22 release RVCE Hello iWAN 22 is targeted for the March 2017 RVCE Thank You RVCE Hello Just an update  iWAN 22 is supported on 1633 and 1563M2 or higher maintenance releases It means its not supported on 164x or 165x iWAN 221 was targeted to 1661 and 1573M RVCE Thanks mate how many dmvpn tunnel termination on 1 hub router

using QoS to control traffic over gre tunnel,my user have an application server that is resided in my data centrethis server is used to push datacontent to windows client machinemy site router for ipvpn gre tunnel have a 20Mb bandwidth circuitevery time the user start publishing his content to the clients at the sites machines the 20Mb link get congested affecting other traffic like inhouse application and web trafficthe application uses port http https tcp 555111 and tcp 55513how can i control the traffic to around 7580 to prevent the link from getting congested i have around 11 sites all have 20Mb circuit for ipvpn all except 1 uses cisco 1941 router,Hello the below should work Make sure you configure qos preclassify on the tunnel This example polices traffic from the server with IP address 19216811 to host 1010101 The policed limit is 16MB accesslist 101 permit tcp host 19216811 host 1010101 eq 55511accesslist 101 permit tcp host 19216811 host 1010101 eq 55513accesslist 101 permit tcp host 19216811 host 1010101 eq 80accesslist 101 permit tcp host 19216811 host 1010101 eq 443 classmap matchall POLICEPUSH match accessgroup 101 policymap POLICE16MB class POLICEPUSH police cir 16000000 conformaction transmit exceedaction drop class classdefault fairqueue int tunnel0 servicepolicy output POLICE16MB qos preclassify RVCE BTW you only need qos preclassify if you need to see a copy of the preencapsulate packets header at the physical interface the tunnel is using for egress RVCE do i configure it on the site router or my core router at data centre RVCE Do you have an IP for the server that pushes datacontent Does it otherwise talk to your remote hosts If answers are yes and no you should be able to just match on the servers source IP What Georg shows will work but I suggest using shaping and a hierarchal policy that gives little priority to the push traffic This will help insure a push has very little impact on your other traffic but will also allow it to use all availableexcess bandwidth For example pollicymap ParentShaper class classdefault shape average 20000000 servicepolicy Childpolicymap Child class fromPushServer banwidth remainig percent 1 class classdefault bandidth remaining percent 99 fairqueueint tunnel  servicepolicy output ParentShaper RVCE i do have the server ip addres it push content to clients on different subnets each subnet have a number of clients getting the content from the server ranging from 10 to 20 RVCE Having multiple remote subnets doesnt matter As long as you get the client update traffic into its assigned queue youll avoid that traffic being adverse to other network trafficSomething we havent addressed is return traffic for the client updates If you have enough site clients that are having traffic pushed to them and they do something like a TCP ACK enough of that could be adverse to the remote to hub traffic If it is you could implement QoS on the remote side too

Cisco 1941SECK9 password recovery,Hello community I have a Cisco 1941 router that I need help with password recovery Here is part of the boot screen when connected to terminal via console portReadonly ROMMON initializedPASSWORD RECOVERY FUNCTIONALITY IS DISABLEDI searched on internet and it appears that with password recovery functionality being disabled it is not easy to restore the router to factory default Your help will be greatly appreciated,Hi This link could be useful httppacketlifenetblog2010oct11recoveringnoservicepasswordrecoveryservice  RVCE Thanks for your reply I will follow those suggestions but as far as I remember I found them while searching for the solution but did not see the prompt while router was booting  Send the break signal at this point The router was booting all the way to the prompt asking for a user name and no break signal would stop I will try again when get back to my office and let you knowThanks again RVCE Hello in addition to Julios post the sledgehammer method would be to open the chassis of your 1941 and reseat the NVRAM which should erase anything stored on it including the startup config
Reip route Null 0 concept,HiWhat is the purpose of giving ip route null 0 command in address like this one ip route 1022122475 255255255255 Null0I need to clear the concept because in the following thread httpssupportforumsciscocomthread24582 it was mention that you can you it for route summarization but here we have given the particular IP so what is purpose of using null 0 with itThanks Solved Go to Solution,As others in this thread have mentioned there are several uses of a static route to null 0 It can be used as part of summarization though that does not seem to be the case here And it can be used to be sure that an entry is in the routing table so that it will be advertised by protocols such as BGP though that does not seem to be the case here And it can be used to silently discard traffic which might be the case hereThink about a situation in which you have detected that a host perhaps 1022122475 is probing your network or is generating unwelcome traffic into your network You want to prevent traffic from being returned to that host One alternative would be to configure access list filtering to deny traffic to that host But configuring access list filtering introduces complexity into the configuration and overhead into the operation of the router You could configure the static route as you mention and it would achieve the same result  no traffic is sent to 1022122475 There is not complexity in the configuration and there is not extra overhead in evaluating the access listHTHRick1022122475sthashtgNfdTWcdpuf RVCE HiNull 0 interface is used to discard traffic destinated to paritcular network It also help to summarize network prefix as you saidIt is good practice to add theese routes internet facing router ip route 10000 255000 Null0ip route 1721600 25524000 Null0ip route 19216800 25525500 Null0Theese routes do not allow route packets with private addresses in destination field of IP header to internetTo be honest I do not see any logic to route host prefix to Null0 interface but it depends on topology design maybe it makes sense for administratorBest Regards Please rate helpful posts Best Regards Please rate all helpful posts and close solved questions RVCE In some cases where NNI network aslo use to avoid the loop RVCE ip route 10000 255000 Null0 we have configured and in bgp we have config the redistribute static but 10000 segment showing in advertise routes how to avoid on this without removing null 0 route RVCE HiNormally is used with summarization as said to avoid forwarding loops Other common use is for security doing black hole routing with BGPFor example lets say that router A is a CE doing summarization configuring manually 10110 2552552550 null 0 and advertising this prefix to the PE On the other hand is receiving the default route from the PE Lets suppose that the CE is receiving the specifics routes of this aggregate via an IGP and suddenly it stops receiving one of them the 1011025 Other site try to communicate with host 101110 as the CE does not know how to reach the packet via the specifics routes received from the LAN it chooses the 1011024 and it drops the packet You may see that without configuring the route pointing to null 0 just configuring the same route pointing to the next hop of the LAN the CE would choose the default route received from the PE and this one will choose the 1011024 towards the CE then the CE does the same choosing the default and so on and the forwarding loop will exist until the TTL expiresRouting protocols OSPF BGP and EIGRP will install by default a discard route automatically when they do summarization via area x rangesummary address in OSPF aggregateaddress in BGP and ip summaryaddress in EIGRPSo basically route to null 0 is used to avoid the election of less specific routeHope this helpsJose RVCE HelloBasically any ip address not matched within the null interface statement gets blacked holed instead of being loop around the network until the ttl expires  I would say a very useful command to useresPaulPlease dont forget to rate this post if it has been helpful Please dont forget to rate any posts that have been helpfulThanks RVCE As i understood itA route packet sent to loopback will end up sending a ICMP unreachable from the router to the transmitting host Whereas a packet sent to null interface will not send anything back to the transmitting host This had security applications where you dont necessarily want to advertise what your networking infrastructure looks like and you have reason to route stuff to null eg and ISP who wants to be a good netcitizen and routes RFC 1918 addresses to nullHTHTony RVCE As others in this thread have mentioned there are several uses of a static route to null 0 It can be used as part of

a null route on the customers ip address and discarding the traffic RVCE Thanks for confirming my explanation by supplying a real world experience of it Discarding traffic by using a static route to null 0 is simpler and less overhead than having to configure an access list and apply the access list to interfacesHTHRick RVCE Very Nice Explanation by Richard Thanks Jawad RVCE Thanks to all of you

IP SLA TimersFlapping,Hello Today I was expermenting with IPSLA in GNS3During my intial experment my IP SLA kept flapping during failover I fixed that with a source interface command Then I noticed IP SLA was passingfailingpassfailpass at 60 second intervals I fixed that with the following screenshot Can someone explain line by line what the Thresholdtimeout and other timers do exactly It seems like I fixed my issue but if I put this in production I dont want to cause a mini Ping DDOS attack on my ISP In the end my SLA should ping every 60 seconds without fail The defaults seem to timeout my primary route before that happens and fails Solved Go to Solution,Hi JoshuaThreshold is used to calculate the monitoring statistics configured for a SLA the time is in miliseconds 1000 miliseconds  1 seg Basically it is used to monitor the behavior and store information about the events Timeout a time in milisecons as well where the SLA is waiting for a response of a requested packet it should not be a higher value than the frequency It is basically the maximun time to complete a SLA operation You can see the round trip time through show ip sla monitor statisticsFrequency A time in seconds Sets the rate at which a specified IP SLAs operation repeats You can use show ip sla statistics to see the SLA behavior It will not generate any problem you could use a frequency of 60 in order to be for example making ping each 60 secondsThe following is recommended by Ciscofrequencyseconds   timeoutmilliseconds   Ntimeoutmilliseconds   thresholdmilliseconds where N  numpacketsnumberofpackets   intervalinterpacketinterval Reference httpswwwciscocomcenustddocsiosxmliosipslacommandslacrbookslas2htmlwp3249187301 Hope it is useful RVCE Hi JoshuaThreshold is used to calculate the monitoring statistics configured for a SLA the time is in miliseconds 1000 miliseconds  1 seg Basically it is used to monitor the behavior and store information about the events Timeout a time in milisecons as well where the SLA is waiting for a response of a requested packet it should not be a higher value than the frequency It is basically the maximun time to complete a SLA operation You can see the round trip time through show ip sla monitor statisticsFrequency A time in seconds Sets the rate at which a specified IP SLAs operation repeats You can use show ip sla statistics to see the SLA behavior It will not generate any problem you could use a frequency of 60 in order to be for example making ping each 60 secondsThe following is recommended by Ciscofrequencyseconds   timeoutmilliseconds   Ntimeoutmilliseconds   thresholdmilliseconds where N  numpacketsnumberofpackets   intervalinterpacketinterval Reference httpswwwciscocomcenustddocsiosxmliosipslacommandslacrbookslas2htmlwp3249187301 Hope it is useful
BGP with two ISP,HelloI have CCNP but unfortunately dont have real experiance with BGP We have some issue in my company We have 2 BGP peer with 2 ISP they advertise to us full BGP table but because our core router is very old we dont have enough memory to have 2 full bgp table Well replace him soon but what is soon maybe 23 month or one year   so we need some solution nowFirst i think that with one ISP we have full BGP table primary and with other only def route secondary Is this feasible in real world Can i do something wit BGP atribibutes like AS PATH and say that i only want inbound route from first ISP  Please if you have any suggestion what to do what is best practise i would like to hear thatThanks and i wish all the best Srdjan Raicevic,Hello there are many ways to achieve your objective The easiest would probably be to use a prefix list filter on your secondary ISP that allows only the default route ip prefixlist DEFAULTONLY seq 5 permit 00000 neighbor xxxxxxxx prefixlist DEFAULTONLY in RVCE HiGeorge has provided a good solution you can use routemap to define which networks you want to receive or just a default network provided by the ISP it will help you to decrease the RIB and it will use less CPU utilization Example ip prefixlist PREFIXES seq 5 permit 111132ip prefixlist PREFIXES seq 5 permit 222232ip prefixlist PREFIXES seq 5 permit 333332 routemap ISP1 permit 5match ip address prefix PREFIXESset localpreference 1000 routemap ISP1 deny 100 ISP2 for redundancy routemap ISP2 permit 5match ip address prefix PREFIXESset localpreference 500 routemap ISP2 deny 100 router bgp Xneighbor 10002 remote Yneighbor 10002 routemap ISP1 inneighbor 10003 remote Zneighbor 10003 routemap ISP2 in clear ip bgp  soft  Also you could include ASPATH attribute to have symmetric traffic Hope it is useful RVCE HelloWhat you dont mention is this just one rtr with two ISP peerings or two rtrs connected together via an IGP or IBGP with an ISP peering each BGP PA attribute manipulation is the way to go but it would all depend what topology you have to what is best for you implement  but one thing is certain you need to make sure you DO NOT become a transit path for either ISP that would be very detrimental to your siteresPaul Please dont forget to rate any posts that have been helpfulThanks RVCE Hi Just to add to this If you are planning on receiving full routes via ISPA and then a default route via ISPB then ISPB will never be used for egress traffic as the full routes via ISPA will be more specific If you are happy with this and want to use ISPA as primary and ISPB as backup for egress traffic then its probably not worth receiving full routes from either ISP and request that they both advertise you with a default route You can then use BGP localpreference to prefer one default over the other Hope this helps
bgp advertisemapnonexistmap timer,Hello AllWe have implemented BGP with our 2 ISPs and running conditional advertisemap to switch over Our end routers are ASR1001As soon as one ISP goes down the hold timer of 90 seconds configured manually run After which BGP waits for some random amount of time before advertising the network to other ISP This random time varies from 6 Seconds to 55 Seconds The logs says that BPG4 Condition DEFAULTINTERNALMAPISP2 changes to Advertise after which advertisement startsWe are clear with the process But we are not sure what is this random time it takes to run the advertisemap condition This random time actually adds up in the downtime expected only 90 Seconds  hold time We have tested this condition several times all the times the advertisemap runs at different timesIs there any cisco documentknowledge to find the exact timing for advertisemap to run for calculating conditional output  it would be very helpful if someone shares the hint where to find the answer Thanks,Hello Ravi To understand how conditional advertisement CA works you also need to understand the BGP Scanner process as thats what triggers the CA process The default time for BGP scanning is 60 secs and CA can kick in sooner depending on when the tracked route is removed from the BGP table and when the next instance of the scanning occurs You can go through the CA feature in the link below and further down you will see reference to BGP Scanner httpwwwciscocomcenussupportdocsipbordergatewayprotocolbgp16137condadvhtml RVCE Hi Ravii have a similar situation i would like to solve router bgp XXXX timers bgp 1 3 bgp scantime 5 neighbor XXX1 advertisemap RMPISP2OUT existmap RMPEXISTMAPCORELOOPBACKS However the BGP scan timer lowered to 5 seconds does not seem to impact the conditional advertisment CA timer Is there an undocumented Ninjastyle TAC command which could help override standard IOS CA related timers Thanks Colin RVCE Colin The BGP scanner sequence is as follows General scan followed by Unicast RIB scan followed by NextHop scan The scan time is the interval between scans and not the length of time for each scan Use debug ip bgp events to observe the scanner activity and the time interval RVCE Hello in addition to the other posts you can set the neighbor advertisementinterval to 0 30 seconds is the default for eBGP neighbor xxxx advertisementinterval 0 Also check if your ISP supports BFD see the link below for details Here is what the configuration of your local BGP router should look like interface GigabitEthernet01 ip address 192168101 2552552550 bfd interval 50 minrx 50 multiplier 3router bgp 1 bgp logneighborchanges neighbor 192168102 remoteas 2 neighbor 192168102 fallover bfd httpswwwciscocomcenustddocsiosiproutebgpcommandreferenceirgbookirgbgp3htmlwp1105562 RVCE Hi guys thanks for your replies I am aware of BFD and I am using BFD where required mainly on routed links between devices and if required I use IPv4 BFD multihop However I am trying to solve the following below where as I am trying to have BGP end to end through my perimiter firewalls This to ensure that the Border routers do not cause a black hole outbound while ensuring the core only uses the path towards the Border router which is still available end to end I would like to have the control plane end to end rather than relying on static routes  IP SLA constructs as the peer may respond to ICMPs but its routing engine is down and or its neigbor is down Another thing I would like to cover is that I can ensure the firewall is only routing traffic while its ACL firewall engine and NAT address translation service is still operational This is probably the biggest problem currently as I am not aware of any firewall vendor which injects its ACL engine  NAT engines operational status somehow into the routing process Meaning the firewall may still route traffic while its no longer firewalling hence I could still attract and drop traffic If someone has a solution to that please share However coming back to BGP advertisemap  existmap  nonexistmaps It seems hard coded within IOS and unless some TAC guy shares some Ninja command this will not change from a 60 second delay no matter if you configure BGP advertisementinterval 0 or not It did not work for me as I had DEBUG IP BGP UPDATES running and could see the update being advertise up to the border routers but the border routes would wait until the CONDITION would be met after approx 60 seconds then widthdraw the 24 outbound to ISP AB However that is not fast enough for most customers today with more and more services going to the cloud  Below solution will not converge faster than 60 seconds  Please prove me wrong  Which brings me to this once again end to end BGP through firewalls However in this instance the CORE devices inside generate the outside 24 prefix via xxxx24 Null 0 routes Those 24s are then picked up by the BGP and advertised outbound to the ISPs ensuring there is not black hole in front or at the back of the firewalls Also the received default routes are being learned from the ISPs and pushed down to the cores end to end This is probably my new solution however this still needs to be labbed up and tested  A few guys may have noticed the MPLS component and go WHY the heckBasically we operate two independant firewalls and one decided to partially die now the idea is to not bind any services to the physical interfaces of the firewalls Meaning we inject 32s into the MPLS transit vrfThis results that we can utilize both border routers for failover having two independant Firewalls And if a Firewall fails we can easily shutdown the injected loopbacks on the partially failing Firewall and enable the same configured 32 on the opposite still working firewall while the default route and advertisements for the 24s outbound still operate We use MPLSL3 VPNs to conserve public IP address space in regards to transit networks required between DCs as we can span multiple DCs without loosing valuable IP addressing Thats some of the background info in order to understand my end to end designs Thanks for your replies comments and feedbacksTHX Colin RVCE Colin The neighbor advertisementinterval on the Border routers should work effectively for you There is no special TAC command required See output below of how quick the updates were sent both for advertise and withdraw Scantime was set to 5 secs Obviously my BGP table is small Yours may have many prefixes R3configrouterneighbor 1551131

Best Practice commands on a trunk port,Long story short main network guy left immediately didnt show me much learning trialbyfireSetting up some replacement switches Connecting them via trunking Was wondering if there were any Best Practice commands that I should have on a trunk portHe had no spanningtree bpduguard enable and ST guard rootDoing some reading and maybe spanningtree commands arent good for trunk portsThis might be as dumb a question as they come but just in case its answerable what is a Best Practice commands for trunk portsAll cisco switchesThanks If this question is too opened stupid Ill just close itlet it die Solved Go to Solution,Hi No the question is not stupid Its a good question For trunk ports connecting one switch to another best practice is to identify the vlans you have and just add them to the trunk For example Interface te111 description linkto switch1 or whatever description you want to add here switchport switchport mode trunk switchport trunk allowed vlan 23 510 The lase line say you have vlan 2 and 3 and 5 through 10 If you dont add the last command all 4096 vlans will be on the trunk and that is not best practice HTH RVCE Hi Are there any other commands that are helpful Maybe something in place to shut the port down if theres a loop or help direct traffic better for a trunk port Spanning tree will prevent loop when there are multiple connections between the switches or multiple switches are daisy changed together So it all depends on your design If you have for example an access switch connecting to one or 2 other switches in the core the spanning tree will block one link while the other one is forwarding That said you do want to have a good spanning tree configuration among your switches so they can prevent loop right now I just do switchport mode trunk and now the vlan commands nothing else This is good enough If you are connecting a tunk port or 2 to a server you can add this command to the port spanningtree portfast trunk This command is NOT recommended if you are connecting switches together sometimes I have to use mode dynamic desirable and I dont know whywhat the difference is Still looking into that There is no need to worry about this command unless you know exactly why you are doing it HTH RVCE Hi No the question is not stupid Its a good question For trunk ports connecting one

about EtherChannel as well If the trunk ports are fibre optics then think about enabling udld port aggressive dont use this command if the trunk port is copperradio link A lot of people love the command no logging event linkstatus and I tend to disagree because this will enable me to identify if there are links that are unstable Another thing is to search for any errordisable autorecovery commands and review them carefully Things like autorecovery of a port that has gone into errordisable due to UDLD is putting a gun to your head RVCE Glad to help Good Luck

good idea to check the VTP status of all switches and to make sure the core switch in your case most likely is the root for all VLANs RVCE This is happening with about 4 windows PCs and either changing the MAC address of the device or moving ports in the stack typically fixes this This is why I suspect the port channel is causing this I have 9 other closets identically configured and they are NOT having any issues RVCE Hello changing the MAC address or moving ports fixes itdo you have sticky MAC configured  Can you post the config of a problem port  RVCE Its pretty simple config really

AutoQos40CiscoPhoneInputPolicy servicepolicy output AutoQos40OutputPolicyend The devices that this happens to can communicate with other devices on the same VLAN when it happens They cant get to the core L3 switch when this occurs RVCE Hello the port configuration looks normal Are these devices getting their addresses through DHCP  If so does the problem persist when you assign a static IP address  Which image are you running eg Lanbase  RVCE Yes they get the address from DHCP The devices have a valid IP address and are able to ping other devices on the same switch stack When they try to go across the port channel that is what is broken RVCE Hello I dont think the port channel or the configuration of the port channel is the problem It sounds more like a random problem with random devices Switch uptime can sometimes be a problem have you tried rebooting the problem switches  Also the physical ports are grouped usually 14 58 and so on are physically connected to the same ASIC can you detect a pattern there  Something might show up in the output of show interfaces x can you post the output of one of the ports that is having problems  Regarding the configuration of the access ports you might want to try and configure flowcontrol receive on RVCE Georg the switch stack has been up for about 1 year now I have not tried to reboot it since it is in production and I havent wanted to cause an outage The port channel is using ports from different switches for redundancy Therefore it is not using the same ASICs A show interface x does not show anything that stands out I will look into flow control on those ports RVCE Hello This is happening with about 4 windows PCs and either changing the MAC address of the device or moving ports in the stack typically fixes this This is why I suspect the port channel is causing this I have 9 other closets identically configured and they are NOT having any issues Apologies for so many questionsAre these always the same ports you have issues with or variousMy first thought would be to check the qos mappings if these clients are voip phones with users attached to the phone but you say you move them to different ports withing the same stack and they begin to work Does the etherchannel or access ports show any errorsDoes the switch stack show any inconsistencies  ring speed fullpartial config etcDo you have vtp pruning enabledaswell as your manual pruningIs this switch stack a host stack  ip routing disabled If the etherchannel is problematic then i would expect more than 4 hosts having issues Anyhow have you tried recreating the L2 PC from scratch1 default the physical interfaces and shut them down2 apply the physical interfaces configuration in this case autoquos servicepolicy and lastly channelgroup3 let the logical PC get created and then apply the trunk config on it  including switchport trunk allowed vlan4 enabled physical interfacessh mls qos maps cosdscpsh mls qos maps dscpcossh

RV082 Configurando acesso a rede ,Galera Boa tarde Preciso de ajuda com as configurações dos RVs configurados na rede aqui dá empresa A topologia é Link Roteador 1905  Rv042 ou 082  SW  WLC  APs WiFiAté o Load balance recebo um 29 com o IP público IP Connect WANApós o Load a rede está recebendo IP local 192168xX LANGostaria de saber se dá para configurar 2 rotas no Loadbalance​ e como faço isso Queria colocar um IP público no equipamento que está na frente SW  WLC alguém consegue ajudarO que configuro no LoadBalance as portas VLANPreciso monitorar os equipamentos que estão na frente e estou perdido,
questions about static routes,HiMy boss want to do static route for our MPLS but we have 2 exits for the MPLS feedHe wants the redundancy of these 2 exits How i can do static routes to point to the 2 exit and make them redundantThank you Solved Go to Solution,You can implement IP SLA which can be used to ping a device on the other end for example if this circuit provides internet connectivity then may be you can ping google server and if destination host is not reachable then remove the static route from RIB Yes your thinking is correct As long as next hop is reachable static route with default AD of 1 will remain in the RIB and floating static wont be installed RVCE You do something like this ip route 1110 2552552550 10101010 ip route 1110 2552552550 20202020 If you are just looking for redundancy then you can raise the administrative distance of one of the static routes to value more than 1 then it will only be installed in the RIB when you lose primary static route below is the example for floating static route ip route 1110 2552552550 20202020 2 RVCE Hi Using floating static routes as Coffee mentioned previously Lowest administrative distance is preferred httpwwwciscopresscomarticlesarticleaspp2180209seqNum7 RVCE Hey cofee Thank you for your reply My questions is when I have 2 static routes with 2 different distance When the one with lower distance cannot reach the nexthop the 2nd static will install to the route table However if somewhere alone MPLS is not reachable static route cannot realize it right As the nexthop still available  the traffice still going via the 1st route but the actual mpls link is not working in the middle is there a way to avoid it Thank you RVCE You can implement IP SLA which can be used to ping a device on the other end for example if this circuit provides internet connectivity then may be you can ping google server and if destination host is not reachable then remove the static route from RIB Yes your thinking is correct As long as next hop is reachable static route with default AD of 1 will remain in the RIB and floating static wont be installed RVCE Perfect This is exactly what I want Thank you so much Do you have a good IP SLA documentations to suggest Thank you RVCE Hi Now if you are going to use IP SLA you could use track and EEM script as well for automatic failover You should use icmp echo  it is an example httpssupportforumsciscocomdiscussion11587371eemscriptalertipslafailures other useful link httpswwwciscocomcenussupportdocsiosnxossoftwareiosembeddedeventmanagereem113696eemtshootigp00html The EEM script will be triggered once an event is detected Also you can take in consideration Jons suggestion using dynamic protocols  RVCE You can use static routes as suggested but this is why people use dynamic routing protocols Perhaps explain this to your boss Jon
Packet simulation for QoS testing,Does anyone know if there is an application out there that can do things like send QoS tagged over a network Im struggling to figure out how i can test my qos policies before taking them to a real network,Hello Steven Ostinato for GNS3 would be an option it is open source and free httpswwwgns3commarketplacesoftwarepackettrafficgeneratorandanalyzer RVCE Depending on your needs Cisco devices advanced ping will allow you to set the ToS value RVCE I guess my needs are that if I create a QoS Policy to drop or reclassify certain tags I need to make sure its working as expected
ISR 2811 keeps hanging,I have an ISR 2811 that keeps hanging The router suddenly becomes unresponsive and all the interfaces shutdown The router can only be restored by a hard restart and the interval at which it happens keeps getting shorter It is currently running IOS 124 C2800NMADVIPSERVICESK9M Someone please help,I read another forum and they proposed and IOS upgrade I shall do this upgrade and update on the status afterwards RVCE Do you have a static default route to the an interface rather than an IP What particular 124 release
