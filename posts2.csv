Cisco 887VA FTTCVDSL configuration,Hi folks I am currently working on obtaining my Routing and Switching qualification and thought I would replace my existing router with a Cisco 887VA All was going well when the expected IP address was showing on the dialer interface and able to ping IP and URL Then no web All LAN ports are in the default VLAN and my laptop is connectd to Fa0 via a straight Ethernet cable My laptop obtains the correct IP and default gateway but the LAN card shows Unidentified which means no traffic I specified an IP address and ran windows NETSH resetsreinstalled my NIC for the issue t remain As I have no issues with other routersswitches I am thinking it is my Cisco 887 Anyone able to see if I have missed something in my running config or kindly provide a little advice as using these dialer interfaces has thrown me a little Routershow runBuilding configurationCurrent configuration  1981 bytes No configuration change since last restartversion 151no service

be configured under the ip dhcp pool LANPOOL using dnsserver command not Google DNS But what you are experiencing is almost certainly the MTU issue My view is that you should configure ip mtu 1492 not mtu 1492 under the Dialer0 interface Also will you please try to add the ip tcp adjustmss 1452 under the same interface Will you please let me know if there is any progress Thanks  Regards Antonin RVCE Hi These are my observations 1 The default router under ip dhcp pool LANPOOL should be configured as defaultrouter 1921681150 ie your int Vlan1 address 2 The ip nat outside should be configured under interface Dialer0 I do not understand why you would need Dialer1 at all 3 The ip nat inside source  should be configured only as follows ip nat inside source list 1 interface Dialer0 overload 4 The default route should be configured as ip route 0000 0000 Dialer0 Will you please try to modify and let me know the result Thanks  Regards Antonin RVCE Thanks Antonin I really appreciate the help as the router is online with my laptop no longer showing unidentified and can ping IP address I specified Google DNS on my NIC and now able to get web pages all be it a little limited as Google searches return results but clicking a URL gives a spinning timer I changed my MTU to 1500 from 1492 as this is the default on my ISP provided router but getting the same issue Next step is to setup the router to provide DNS servers and troubleshoot if that doesnt work To answer your questions I was following different guides online where Dialer1 was used a lot I assume Dialer0 contained their ADSL config which was left in place and shutdown with ATM0 I had not changed my default route back for this reason and got a little twisted for my NAT A little further work is needed but progress

RVCE Folks Victory Thanks my laptop is now connected via Ethernet to Fa0 and getting web pages with IPDNS set to auto obtain from the router The fix Antomin I changed the MTU back to 1492 and used the ip tcp adjustmss 1452 within the dialer0 interface and got web pages straight away This is something I have not done in Packet Tracer before maybe yet when configuring switches and routers I have covered the theory and understand the packet changes routing through different interfaces but thought the router would have handled this automatically A little reading on my end before quizzing the lecturer  Georg Pauwen you solved my DNS issue nicely I was going to use my ISP DNS but wasnt sure how to set the router to obtain dynamically So I thought I would set Google DNS but did it in the wrong place This is what i need at the moment and will come back to your other highlighted changes when I connect my test lab The next step is connect my wireless AP and other devices to ensure all is working Then sort out the SSH connection refused error and setup port forwarding for my Virtual Machine After this connect my Cisco test lab 2 x 2801 and 2 x 2960 TTL 1 x 1801 and a L3 switch when I have this setup Packet Tracer is good but doesnt beat bare metal I appreciate the quality and speed of help here and will post my working config now then my setup steps once I have sorted through my

first to admit that I am still learning my way around Cisco Routersexpecially when it comes to config filesdo you have a suggestion as to where I should proceed from here I am curious about these two lines should they both be in there ip nat inside source list 1 interface GigabitEthernet01 overloadip route 0000 0000 GigabitEthernet01 dhcp this is the dfault route then RVCE Hello glad that you got the speed up Basically anything like access llists IDS etc you configure the router with that goes on top of basic connectivity slows it down since it has to be processed ip nat inside source list 1 interface GigabitEthernet01 overload  this just means that everything defined in access list 1 gets translated to the IP address of interface GigabitEthernet01ip route 0000 0000 GigabitEthernet01 dhcp  this sends all traffic to the SurfBoard The dhcp keyword is basically the same as putting an IP address as the next hop in the static route statement but since you dont know the address dhcp is used Defining an IP address as the next hop is usually faster than defining an interface since in the latter case the router has to ARP for the next hop RVCE okI did some reading and I understand that thanks for the explaination Now I tried to add just a little of my access list and it broke everything I added just the following  accesslist 1 remark INSIDEIFGigabitEthernet00accesslist 1 permit

why this would break it It need the SPECTRUM DHCP well so it allows port 6768 to do the dhcp RVCE Hello basically an access list has an implicit deny so anything you do not explicitly allow will be blocked Where is the Spectrum located that is what is the IP address  You can also use the Cisco as DHCP server by adding the below ip dhcp excludedaddress 19216801  ip dhcp pool LAN network 19216800

break everythingThe config I had sent here was working fine when I had the 20mps1mps servicethen when I upgraded to the 100mbps10mbps everything went nutsthankfully you pointed me in the right directionwith the basic config file I got the speeds back But when I add the just this part it all dies The Spectrum part allows them to do dhcp ports 6768 but if I add it no good The

Monitor total throughout  ISR4K,Hi is there a way to monitor the actual platform hardware throughput level on an ISR4K Cheers Jp,show platform hardware throughput level RVCE Hi Hector that just shows the total that can be used Not the actual amount being used RVCE The command that is closest to real time throughput utilization for the ISR 4400 family is show platform hardware qfp active datapath utilization RVCE Thanks is there an OID for this so I can graph it over time RVCE When comparing with the throughput license do you only count either input or output I imagine 100Mbps through the qfp is what is licensed Thanks And yes an OID would be nice
Nexus Sup1 upgrade from 628 to 6216,Hi guysthe plan is to upgrade nexus sup1 from 628 to 6216i have run the install command as per below and it looks i can do direct upgradeThe result is good there is no incompatibility issue However when i check the upgrade guide for direct upgrade to 6216 the minimum version is 628aCisco Nexus 7000 Series NXOS Software Upgrade and Downgrade Guide Release 6x  Cisco Current ReleaseReleases That Support Direct ISSU to the Current ReleaseISSDNXOS Release 6218628a 628b 6210 6212 6214 6216No SupportNXOS Release 6216628a 628b 6210 6212 6214No Support Questions1 can i perform direct upgrade from 628 to 6216 using ISSU or i need to upgrade to supported version first ie 628a 2 If i use manual upgrade can i directly upgrade to 8216 version normally how long is the down time thanks guys,Hi Yes you can go directly to 6216 2 If i use manual upgrade can i directly upgrade to 8216 version normally how long is the down time I would plan on upgrading the switch manually The boot time should not exceed 15 minutes so you just need a short window HTH
Cisco QoS  how to use traffic shaping for interface and bandwidthpriority for classes,I have VPLS MPLS which looks like a layer 2 switch to me carrier networks and Im currently developing QoS policies for them I have some sites with a 1000 physical link and CIRs like 50 mb 100 mb etc I need to do traffic shaping on these with a service policy otherwise I get drops and less performance with many traffic types The challenge is that as Im implementing various traffic classes in my QoS policy I it seems I can no longer traffic shape the entire physical interface to 50 mbps for example Instead I have to shape per traffic class which is really not what I want to do I would like to be able to shape the entire interface to 50 mbps then alot traffic types 30 20 of that etc and allow them to use more if it is available I am also using the priority queue for VoIP and I know it cant use extra available bandwidth since it is the priority queue Is there a way to do this while also shaping the entire interface I appreciate any tips,Hi Which router are you using and IOS version What config did you apply when saying you cant do shaping on interface Can you share your config I mean we always do HQOS with 1 policymap shaping the physical interface and then calling a 2nd policymap on which you define every classes When youre saying you cant shape the interface do you have any error message or how you determine shaping isnt working ThanksFrancescoPS Please dont forget to rate and select as validated answer if this answered your question RVCE Francesco Thank for the reply I guess I just wasnt familier with this type of nested QoS Im using mostly ISR 4Ks with IOS XE 031606 and ASRs with IOS XE 031603 So is the preferred best practice method is to do something like this interface GigabitEthernet000 servicepolicy output 50mbpsShape   policymap 50mbpsShape class classdefault shape average 50000000 servicepolicy QOS policymap QOS class VOIP priority percent 10 set cos 5 class CLASS2 bandwidth percent 40 set cos 4 etc RVCE Yes this is best practices because I mean you want to shape globally but want to define different type of bandwidth per class right But using just the shape in class default should work also ThanksFrancescoPS Please dont forget to rate and select as validated answer if this answered your question RVCE Your on the right track as also confirmed by FrancescoA couple of things to be aware of WAN providers count bandwidth at L2 but Its my belief that many Cisco shapers only count bandwidth at L3 If you find this true on your device you may want to shape at about 15 slower or whatever you think best represents your average L2 overheadYou might ask whether your provider is willing to tell you what they use for Bc andor Tc If they do you can configure your shaper to more accurately conform with how they enforce your CIRYour policy is setting CoS which is unusual unless you have a tagged VLAN handoffBTW for I am also using the priority queue for VoIP and I know it cant use extra available bandwidth since it is the priority queue thats not always true on Cisco devices On many the implicit policer only engages if PQ packets are queued
Two remote site at a different locations havong a same subnet,Hi I still confused on how to implement this Currently we have to remote site having a same subnet 1921681x24 Both sites using the same subnet and we need to connect to this site Both site will terminated at our CE router in their country From my site our CE to their CE routed via BGP using same ISP SITE A  1921681024SITE B  1921681024 we need to connect to both sites from our HQ office here Can this be done,Good morning You cant advertise two identical subnets onto the same common network youll cause yourself a world of pain There are two options ReIP one of the sites to remove the conflict or You could look to NAT one of the subnets to an alternative IP address range Cisco have written a handy document that will help you if you look to attack this issues with option 2 The link is below httpswwwciscocomcenussupportdocsipnetworkaddresstranslationnat137743html Thanks Simon RVCE Hi Simon Thanks for the very helpfull information Our customer is on production for more than ten years and now they have to connect to our office in Kuala Lumpur Ive been thinking about onetoone NAT and also parent  child VRF which I think is quite complicated Since the connection to our office is via mpls VRF might be the best way to solved this Regards Hakim Kipli RVCE You need to tie the sites together using L2 NB there are some technologies which allow L2 across L3 RVCE Hi Jason Thanks for the information Technically how this can be done based on your suggestion Your idea would help me a lot in this implementation Thanks HAKIM KIPLI RVCE Hi JasonWere you directing this question to meIf so technologies like L2TPv3

Locally originated route with an higher AD will be prefered over the BGP learnt route,Hi AllPlease refer the diagram I have a requirement to add a static route on a hub router pointing to the secondary network and advertise it into MPLS cloud 1000024 is the LAN subnet which is already learnt via MPLS at hub location If I add a static route at hub pointing the 4G network with an AD of 100 and advertise them using network statement into MPLS cloud by adding ASPATH does hub router will remove the 1000024 subnet learnt from MPLS because there is a locally originated route which is getting advertised into BGP  If yes what is the solution for this problem Solved Go to Solution,Hello set the weight on the MPLS neighbor to 65535 the highest value The weight of the locally originated route is 32768 by default so the higher weight is preferred RVCE Hello set the weight on the MPLS neighbor to 65535 the highest value The weight of the locally originated route is 32768 by default so the higher weight is preferred RVCE Thank you Georg Pauwen I think that is the solution for my problem However Is there any other option to make MPLS routes preferred over the locally originated static routes just by tweaking the new static route related configurations without touching the existing MPLS neighbor attributes

BGP Fundamentals Help,Hi guys I am currently studying up on BGP and have a few queries of three scenarios which I cannot understand Can you help with below Scenario 1 There are two networks Network 1 within the 1921681024 subnet and Network 2 within the 1921682024 subnet Both have a single connection to SP1 which runs BGP within AS 1000Network 1s CE Router has a default route to the SP1 PE Router as does Network 2 which are redistributed to their respective IGPsIf Network 1 wants to talk to IP addresses within Network 2 how does this happen Scenario 2 There are two networks Network 1 and Network 2 are both within the 1921681024 subnet Both have a single connection to SP1 which runs BGP within AS 1000Network 1s CE Router has a default route to the SP1 PE Router as does Network 2 which are redistributed to their respective IGPsIf Network 1 wants to talk to IP addresses within Network 2 how does this happen when they are within the same subnet Scenario 3 There are two networks Network 1 within the 1921681024 subnet and Network 2 within the 1921682024 subnet Both have two connctions to SP1 which runs BGP within AS 1000Network 1 and Network 2 just so happen to share the same AS number 65530 and taks to SP1 via BGPIf Network 1 wants to talk to IP addresses within Network 2 how does this happen when the AS numebrs are the same Thanks in advance ,Hi Apologies if I understanding incorrectly but Networks 1 and 2 are on the same customer side configured on the CE router or are they different routers could you please share the topologies If you are have an eBGP with the ISP basically the ISP must provide the AS number to be used on the client side Thank you in advance  RVCE Thank you for the reply Imagine they are two completely different sites connected to two completely different PE routers RVCE Thank you for the clarification Now if you have 2 switches connected to the same ISP through BGP probably the ISP is using MPLS to move the traffic from the site A to site B now it should be transparent for you now the ISP will be involved on the routing procedures Site A and the site B will be advertising their networks through BGP to their BGP peers in this case to the ISP take in consideration if both sites A and B have the same AS number for example 1000 the ISP must be informed to apply ASOverride in order to enable the flow of the networks otherwise the site A and B will not be able to reach the networks from each other because the iBGP rule Split Horizon rule

2960C performance,Hello all one of our customers uses the 2960c at a lot of locations but at one location we see some strange behavior when it comes to performanceThe location has this setup 887VA DSL router for EVPN connectivity2 2960C switches1800 access points303 VDSL EVPN connection30040 Docsis Internet connection The DSL is for corporate use the other connection is for clients this is a healthcare customerThe location has an Internet connection with a Docsis modem The connection is  30040 Mbps For a part of the network the Docsis modem is also DHCPserver and router The Docsis modem is directly connected to Gi02 on the 2960C This port is configured as an access port If we test the internet connection connected to one of the fast ethernet interfaces on the 2960C the download speed tops at 4041 Mbps It does not matter if one client of several clients are using this switch The upload speed during tests is conform what the ISP allows If I move the link to the Docsis modem to a fast ethernet interface the results are even more dramatic because then the download speed drops to 10 Mbps If I change the vlan to break out via the EVPN the download speed goes to 30 Mbps One should be able to expect near 100 Mbps performance so in summarylaptop  fast ethernetdocsis modem  gigabitdownload max 40 Mbps laptop  fast ethernetdocsis modem  fast ethernetdownload max 10 Mbps laptop  fast ethernetinternet via EVPN 881 is connected to a gig interfacedownload max 30 Mbps A client directly connected to the Docsis modem gets the full monty when it comes to performance To rule out any interop issues I placed a 891 router between the Docsis modem and the 2960c knowing that it will not give us max speed and the results stayed the same Directly connected to the 891 gave me 120 Mbps down routed but also when using the switch only The portconfig for the tested ports are switchport mode accessswitchport access vlan 34spanningtree portfast The switces were originally running a late 12255 version I upgraded them to 1526E and downgraded one of the two switches there are 2 at this location to 1522E7 This made no difference There are two other locations with a similar setup One site shows the same behavior the other does not a speedtest on an iPhone gave 80Mbps down The main difference is the two slow site use a Connect Box docsis modem and the other uses an older Cisco Docsis modem My first thought was interop issue but the test with the 891 router ruled that out CPU and memory use were always low during the tests I am a bit lost where to look for a solution The customer already tested with a few el cheapo switches and the performance was good on those so that also bugs us Any ideas  With kind regards Marcel Tempelman Solved Go to Solution,Switch to DOCSIS is gig Client to switch is FE If so 2960 and 35603750 switches often have insufficient buffers for the speed slow down especially if QoS is enabled and running with defaults Any drops show on switch portsHave you tried DOCSIS and client at gigAm I reading correctly you did try DOCSIS and client at FE If so that too was slow For that perhaps the DOCSIS cannot sufficient queue packets You might clientDOCSIS at both FE and gig and see how they compare RVCE Switch to DOCSIS is gig Client to switch is FE If so 2960 and 35603750 switches often have insufficient buffers for the speed slow down especially if QoS is enabled and running with defaults Any drops show on switch portsHave you tried DOCSIS and client at gigAm I reading correctly you did try DOCSIS and client at FE If so that too was slow For that perhaps the DOCSIS cannot sufficient queue packets You might clientDOCSIS at both FE and gig and see how they compare RVCE Hello Joseph the DOCSIS modem is connected to the gig port om the 2960c and QoS is enabled I see drops on the fast ethernet ports I havens tried the client on the other gig port A colleague of mine tested with a 2960c and a ASA5505 in front of the DOCSIS and he was able to reach 7080 Mbps conform max perf of the 5505 He has a Ubee DOCSIS modem which is a different one A test with a Cisco DOCSIS modem on another location gave also better results Your analysis seems the right one to me I overestimated the switch performance probably so we might want to go for the CX of another Gig model RVCE Just did a test with a Ubee DOCSIS modem and a 2960c and a simple speedtest gave me 9095 Mbps with and without QoS enabled GigGig gave me 116 Mbps connection is limited to 150 Mbps FaFa set the limit around 65 Mbps So it seems the DOCSIS plays a crucial role in this RVCE Iperf3 test between 2 laptops GigCGigS SUM 0001000 sec 110 GBytes 942 Mbitssec senderSUM 0001000 sec 110 GBytes 942 Mbitssec receiver GigC  100MS 60 SUM 0001000 sec 114 MBytes 954 Mbitssec sender60 SUM 0001000 sec 113 MBytes 950 Mbitssec receiver I think Ill give the 2960c the benefit of the doubt

Nat overload and IPSLA,I have a Cisco ISR that I am trying to add two ISPs for basic internet traffic I configured IP sla and tracking so that when ISP1 fails ISP2 becomes the gateway of last resort This works exactly how I expect it However I am confused on how NAT plays into this setup I have a NAT overload configured on Gi000 for the primary But I cannot figure out how the second NAT overload can be placed on Gi001 when ISP1 fails Is there some sort of NAT tracking similar to how I can track with IP SLAs,You use the same NAT statmnet that you are using for ISP1 for ISP2 as well ip nat inside source routemap ISP1 interface gi000 overload ip nat inside source routemap ISP2 interface gi001 overload Asumming you have 2 default routes when the first one failes the second ISP should start forwarding traffic HTH RVCE I was assuming the same thing however here is the reply I get back Cannot change mappings interface name remove mapping first I technically do not have two default gateways since I am using IP tracking I have one GLR until it becomes unreachable then it gets replaced with the second GLR RVCE Why cant you add a second static route twards the second provider as well Assuming isp1 is primary and isp2 is backup ip route 0000 0000 isp1 ip route 0000 0000 isp2 10 This way the first one is your primary and the second one is on standby since it has higher admin to take over in case the first one fails HTH RVCE Reza Your configuration would work but the problem is ip route 0000 0000 isp1 Lets say the address for ISP1 is 3332 and my address interfacing that router is 3333 If ISP1 loses internet connectivity further down the LEC I would still be able to reach 3332 even though the internet is down due to a connection further along the communications chain Therefore my gateway would still point to this GLR and not the isp2 gateway with the higher metric This is why I am using IP sla So if I cannot ping say 8888 from my ISP1 interface then I deem that connection down and my routing table pulls 0000 0000 isp1 and replaces it with 0000 0000 isp2 10 All of this part explained above works however Im still at a lose with my NAT overload as I cannot add that state with this current configuration RVCE Hello in addition to Rezas remarks an alternative might be an EEM script that activates the backup interface and also clears the existing NAT translations Post the full config of your ISR so I can add the necessary bits and pieces for this approach RVCE Georg I think the EEM script may do the trick I could have a script pull the Current NAT statement and replace it with the ISP2 NAT However I would think with the nature of SLAs and IP tracking Cisco would have a way of dynamically updating NAT along SLA events RVCE Hello post the config you currently have At the very least the EEM script should clear the current NAT translations
ms server cisco RS,HI  guys1do we use ms servers in cisco r  s environment 2 is ms server is completely a separate platform Regards rammon,Hi Q 1do we use ms servers in cisco r  s environment  Ans No you cannt Q 2 is ms server is completely a separate platform Ans A Router is a device that transmits  receives information from the network in a controlled mannerie a router has an ability to route information to specific devices connected to the network A server is a computer designed to process requests and deliver data to other client computers over a local network or the internet or the cloud Regards Deepak Kumar RVCE Hi Thank you deepak i will wait for other people opinions also regards rammon

EEM Log Issue,I have EEM applet scripts configured to apply some commands to help with failover scenarios in the network my concern is the logs that generated continuously informing about the actions Based on the configuration EEM applet is monitoring the interface using the followingevent tag 1 interface name GigabitEthernet003 parameter rxload entryop gt entryval 2 entrytype value pollinterval 30And as a result all the log show the actions applied every 30 seconds and that provide a misleading information that the actions are continuously applied to the router every 30 secondsHave anyone get the same issue or is it the way I have the applet configured Please let me know if you experienced this behavior and how did you resolve it Additional comment is that the EEM applet work fine except for it seems like it continues adding the configuration over and over while the trigger threshold is met,Hello post the full EEM script including the configured actions RVCE event manager applet InterfaceIntersiteNoTraffic description event tag 1 interface name GigabitEthernet003 parameter rxload entryop lt entryval 2 entrytype value pollinterval 30 event tag 1 interface name GigabitEthernet003 parameter rxload entryop lt entryval 2 entrytype value pollinterval 30 action 10 cli command enable action 11 cli command conf t action 12 cli command ip msdp safilter in xxxx list MSDPName action 13 cli command int Gi000 action 14 cli command ip multicast boundary EEMDenyMulticastIN in action 15 cli command clear ip mroute 22999240 action 16 cli command end action 17 cli command wrevent manager applet InterfaceIntersiteTrafficBack description event tag 1 interface name GigabitEthernet003 parameter rxload entryop gt entryval 2 entrytype value pollinterval 30 event tag 1 interface name GigabitEthernet003 parameter rxload entryop gt entryval 2 entrytype value pollinterval 30 action 10 cli command enable action 11 cli command conf t action 12 cli command no ip msdp safilter in xxxx list MSDPName action 13 cli command int Gi000 action 14 cli command no ip multicast boundary EEMDenyMulticastIN in action 15 cli command clear ip mroute 22999240 action 16 cli command end action 17 cli command wr  The following is sample of the log that keep recurring every 30 seconds even after the action were applied after the trigger and when the threshold met 828495 Mar 27 143104 SYS5CONFIGI Configured from console by on vty1 EEMInterfaceIntersiteTrafficBack828496 Mar 27 143133 PARSER5CFGLOGLOGGEDCMD Userunknown user logged commandexec enable828497 Mar 27 143133 PARSER5CFGLOGLOGGEDCMD Userunknown user logged commandno ip msdp safilter in xxxx 828498 Mar 27 143134 PARSER5CFGLOGLOGGEDCMD Userunknown user logged commandinterface GigabitEthernet000 828499 Mar 27 143134 PARSER5CFGLOGLOGGEDCMD Userunknown user logged commandno ip multicast boundary EEMDenyMulticastIN in 828500 Mar 27 143134 SYS5CONFIGI Configured from console by on vty1 EEMInterfaceIntersiteTrafficBack RVCE GeorgDid you get a chance to look at the configuration RVCE Hello sorry for the delay Ill have a look RVCE Hello try and configure the below and check if that stops the logging R3conf tR3configarchiveR3configarchivelog configR3configarchivelogcfgno notify syslog RVCE Georg Thank you so much the commands you provided did work to make the detailed actions go away but I still see the following 846329 Mar 28 145520 SYS5CONFIGI Configured from console by on vty1 EEMInterfaceIntersiteTrafficBack846330 Mar 28 145550 SYS5CONFIGI Configured from console by on vty1 EEMInterfaceIntersiteTrafficBack So my question is does that mean it is not applying the configuration over and over or it just stopped the log information RVCE Hello the action should obviously execute only when the event parameters are matchedwhich is probably not every thirty seonds Ill do some more testing also Ill try to find a way to get rid of the other lines RVCE Hello the easy way to get rid of the console messages is to lower the logging level logging buffered 4 logging trap 4 logging console 4 However that might result in you missing other important messages as well There seems to be another way to restrict messages on a more granular level using the Embedded Syslog Manager Not sure how much time you have but if you want to research that yourself you might be faster than me here is the link Embedded Syslog Manager Configuration Guide Cisco IOS Release 124T httpswwwciscocomcenustddocsiosxmliosesmconfiguration124tesm124tbookesmsysloghtml RVCE Georg Thank you for your time and effort
Data Center Interconnect,I dont know how easy or hard this question is to answer without getting deep into details But here is what I am trying to accomplish I have or will have a data center and two collocations tied together with 10GB DWDM The DC will have a 10GB circuit to each collo and the two collos will be connected via 10GB as well I do not want to create a routed triangle by having the circuits each a L3 p2p I would like for the data center to have to L3 paths to each collo one direct and the other through the other collo So I need to have that collo xconnect between two physical circuits My question is what is the best way to do that Originally I was think I would just use an SVI on the L3 end point with a L2 vlan at the intermediate switch to do the xconnect but I am thinking this may not be the best approach Would EoMPLS or VPLS or something like that be a better solution I really dont know too much about either,Not exactly sure what you are trying to accomplish but I would assume one would want traffic going to the Collos to take the shortest and most direct path The routed triangle sounds the most efficient to me Anyhow yes if you made the links trunk links with VLANs passing through each Colo to the other across the inter Collo link yes you could achieve the desired result I would also prefer DWDM over a MPLS or VPLS solution as it eliminates the need to traverse a providers network Hope this helps RVCE What I am basically trying to accomplish is my DC having redundant paths to each collocation and all my WAN services upstream from the collos domestic WAN international WAN Internet etc but I also want to load share the traffic on those redundant links Each collo also has redundant WAN services When I started looking at the routed triangle solution I could see the potential for a lot fo routing loops and things like that without many benefits over the two collos not talking to each other So I am trying to get each collo to have two paths back to the DC one path is direct over DWDM and the other path is DWDM to the other collo one one circuit and xconnected to another DWDM circuit from that collo to my DC Its that transparent xconnect that I am trying to figure out the best way to approach RVCE So if I understand you correctly the two collos really dont need a direct connection to each other and you want each collo to have redundant equal cost links to the DC One being a direct DWDM connection and the other being a DWDM connection through the other collo Im sure that is possible I guess the question is how who or what is doing the DWDM piece

NBAR2 Protocol Pack and QoS,Hi AllWas just reading a old NBAR2 document relating to Protocol Pack 7 when I saw this note The RTP audiovideo subclassification parameters are generic in nature and will match only on generic RTP traffic More specific classification such as mslyncaudio ciscojabberaudio facetime and ciscophone will not match as RTP and therefore will not match the audiovideo subclassificationRef httpswwwciscocomcenustddocsiosxmliosqosnbarconfigurationxe3sqosnbarxe3sbooknbarprotoclpackhtml Can anyone speak more to this claim and if it is still valid I mean we are now way up on Protocol Pack 33 or 36 for Advanced but if match protocol rtp audio cant actually match stuff like ciscophone audio and ciscojabberaudio then its a pretty damming statement for Cisco and further proof that the entire AVCNBAR2 suite needs to be made a free feature of IPBase on all supported routers I mean I personally have configured heaps of routers with match protocol rtp audio under a classmap for voice and I am sure thousands of others have done it as well Hell I have had multiple Cisco Gold partners turn around and confirm this design and even specifically tell me that match protocol rtp audio will match Cisco IP phones and Cisco Jabber audio calls Am I getting worried over nothing or is this actually a huge gotcha that Cisco and partners alike have managed to overlook,I too recently read that and wondered on the same I was just on the verge of trying protocol rtp audio for Cisco VoIP phones but the need got eliminated so unfortunately I didnt find out If protocol rtp audio didnt work I was prepared to next try protocol rtpIn your reference right above that note mention was made it works if audio is related to SIP which would have also been true for me I too hope others post a response

BGP advertisements,Hi All Im trying to control BGP advertisements and I have two questions about the different possibilities a Is it any way to control the number of prefix to advertise to a neighbor by numberb Can I see the limit of prefixese stablished by my neighbor via maximunprefix from my device for example taking a look on debugs or something like that This is a question for IOS and ASR as well Thanks,I believe that the behavior of IOS and of ASR are similar a while you can control the number of prefixes that are received from a neighbor I do not believe that you can control by number the number of prefixes that you advertise to a neighbor b I do not know of a way to see the limit to number of prefixes established by a neighbor HTH Rick RVCE Hi Rick Bad Luckthank you anyway

updated to change the keywords to units in Mbps and support for maximum throughput values of 100 Mbps 250 Mbps 500 Mbps and 1 Gbps was added Usage Guidelines The Cisco CSR 1000V requires the installation of base licenses that set the maximum throughput of the platform Depending on the configuration and the licenses installed you may need to manually increase or decrease the maximum throughput level on the Cisco CSR 1000V The maximum throughput on the router before the license is activated or if the license is invalidated is 25 Mbps When you install the base subscription license and accept the EULA the maximum throughput on the Cisco CSR 1000V will increase to the level allowed by the license You may need to manually change the maximum throughput level in the following cases If you are using an evaluation license When the evaluation license is first installed the maximum throughput is limited to 25 Mbps before the license is activated You must accept the EULA and enter the platform hardware throughput levelcommand to increase the maximum throughput When the 60day evaluation license expires the maximum throughput level reverts to 25 Mbps If you want to reduce the maximum throughput level from the maximum permitted by the installed licenses For example if you have the 50Mbps license installed and you want to reduce the maximum throughput to 25 Mbps You must enter the platform hardware throughput level command to reduce the maximum throughput If you previously changed the maximum throughput using the platform hardware throughput level command When you enter the command it becomes part of the configuration file You must enter the command again to change the maximum throughput level When changing the maximum throughput level you do not need to reboot the Cisco CSR 1000V for the change to take effect If you try to increase the throughput level higher than what the installed license supports you will receive an error message Examples The following

Cisco 4331 router  No internet access,Dear readersI am running into an issue we are replacing a draytek router model 2130 with a Cisco 4331 routerThe internal network is working fine but I cant seem to get the internet workingI tried searching the forums and looked up multiple Cisco router wan basic setup guides but no success yetThe details that I knowCisco port G000 IP 583216230 EDIT was 32 but should be 30Cisco port G001 IP 1921681005024 that is connected to a 48 port switchDNS servers of the webprovider are 1782178081 and 1782178180 I copied the settings of from the draytek our provider says that is all and that there are no hidden settings that are required aka usernamespasswordsWhen i use the webinterface to do a WAN connection test I get a green checkmark on everything except the ping to 8888I have added in a text file the output of show ip route and show conf since in similar issues that are the most requested outputs at the start Does anyone maybe see what I am overlookingThank you all in advance for your time Solved Go to Solution,Hi Will you please change your default route configuration as follows ip route 0000 0000 5832161 Best regards Antonin RVCE Hello you say that your provider has given you IP 583216232 however you have configured 30 Try interface GigabitEthernet000 ip address 5832162 255255255254 or interface GigabitEthernet000ip address 5832162

to mention one important part we will start working in the future with vlans that will come on 19216850 but that isnt in use yet our entire network at this moment is on 19216810024 The 583216230 is copied from the draytek I added a screenshot of the its WAN configuration page I will do the changes you mentioned straight away sadly because of work hours the draytek is connected again and cant test Will come back to you as soon as possible EDIT just noticed the mistake in the opening post edited it sorry for the confusion RVCE Dear Georg I have changed the settings as recommended but still cant ping 8888 from the router and cant ping 5832162 from the outside Added the new show conf file Is there maybe anything that you still recommend Thank you for all your help RVCE Hi HADES2001 Are you able to ping default gateway5832161 from your router If not then check the interface status like speed and duplex SDWAN SpecialistSpooster IT Services RVCE Hi Will you please change your default route configuration as follows ip route 0000 0000 5832161 Best regards Antonin RVCE Thank you all so much for the help I added ip route 0000 0000 5832161 also removed the spanningtree portfast trunk on port g000 The webinterface wont let me do the WAN test anymore because it keeps saying there is no port configured as WAN anymore But besides that internet is working the port forwards arent working yet so our internal applications cant be accessed from the outside but since we now have internet access and the IP phones are working I can easily sit down for that without having short time frames again thank you all for the assistance hope i gave the helpfull stars away in the proper way new to these forums RVCE Hello take the spanningtree portfast trunk off the outside interface and

post from the original poster I have changed the settings as recommended but still cant ping 8888 from the router if the router can not ping an Internet IP address then that is the first problem that we need to solve Any of the other suggestions about the config should wait till this is solved Having suggested that other topics should wait I feel that I must say that I agree with Antonin that the default route pointing just to Gig000 may be problematic And that is not what the Draytek was using A default route specifying the next hop address or perhaps both outbound interface and next hop address is better and is what the Draytek was using HTH Rick RVCE Having read through the thread again and thinking about the issue I would suggest that the first step should be to find out if the router can ping 5832161 If not then I would ask for the original poster to post the output of the command show ip interface brief HTH Rick RVCE Dont worry I am still here sadly I am stuck on very short time frames because the employees require internet access setting alarm extra early to test all the help just posted internet access is the primary target all other things are on hold Project managers tend to forget that 9 women cant bear a child in 1 months i truelly appreciate all the help from everyone here and will let everyone know tomorrow what the results are

BGP Advertisement,All could you please let me know how to advertise these subnets on BGP attached diagram My understanding is have a static route from the firewall for 1721616024 poitning back to 1010102 and advertise that static route via routemap through ebgp Solved Go to Solution,now will i need a routemap to limit what advertisements i receive  is that a must ANS It is not a must but depending on your environment it is not a bad idea If you know what you are expecting to receive it cant hurt to avoid getting advertisements you dont want It doesnt necessarily have to be done with route maps either You can filter with ACLs aspath prefixlists etc do i need a routemap to limit what i send or is the network statement enough to cover this ANS The network statement should suffice but there is nothing wrong with adding another level of control to avoid advertising anything you dont want Again it doesnt only have to be done with a route map RVCE Simply put for a network to be advertised in BGP it needs to exist in some form The static route to 1010102 meets this requirement You could redistribute the static via BGP or even simpler you could just add it as a network statement in BGP Either one should work Hope this helps RVCE will it work if i add it as a network statement under BGP as the network itself does NOT hang off the firewall is this the same case if it was ospf as well RVCE For BGP to advertise a network it needs to see it in the IGP static EIGRP OSPF etc So as stated earlier the network statement or redistribution of static would work For OSPF to advertise a network with a network statement it needs to be an attached network If it is based on a static route it has to be redistributed as the network statement would not apply Hope that clarifies things RVCE now will i need a routemap to limit what advertisements i receive  is that a must and do i need a routemap to limit what i send or is the network statement enough to cover this RVCE now will i need a routemap to limit what advertisements i receive  is that a must ANS It is not a must but depending on your environment it is not a bad idea If you know what you are expecting to receive it cant hurt to avoid getting advertisements you dont want It doesnt necessarily have to be done with route maps either You can filter with ACLs aspath prefixlists etc do i need a routemap to limit what i send or is the network statement enough to cover this ANS The network statement should suffice but there is nothing wrong with adding another level of control to avoid advertising anything you dont want Again it doesnt only have to be done with a route map RVCE Thanks
EIGRP  adding backup routing,I am distributing static routes into eigrpat two sites Specifically we are using NSX and SRM so that certain VMs have the same IP address at each site Main and Backup At Main I have two sets of IP addresses with a default route to each subnetip route 10010024 1020295ip route 10011024 1020295 At Backup we have the same subnets but want to inject route or influence routing via eigrp so that when Main site goes darkdown the following routes would take over automaticallyip route 10010024 1020395ip route 10011024 1020395 Solved Go to Solution,I think the simplest way to accomplish this would be to just administratively weigh the statics at the backup site to something higher than the redistributed statics 170 at the primary site So then ip route 10010024 1020395 200 ip route 10011024 1020395 200 As long as the primary routes are active and in the routing table these routes shouldnt propagate Once the primary site is offline the secondary routes would then be advertised RVCE Evaluate which one suits your circumstances from the following options 1Embedded Event Manager EEM  Use EEM to track the routing table If the route is not present and learned via EIGRP EEM installs the static route and redistribute via EIGRP 2 Static route tracking using IP SLA  Configure the static routes with IP SLA The use of IP SLA is to monitor the reachability of a particular hosts If the host is not reachable the static route would not be installed in the routing table and thus would not be redistributed to EIGRP 3 Advertise both subnets from main and backup sites but make sure the backup site has higher EIGRP metric set HTH Please rate replies and mark question as answered if applicable RVCE I think it would be best to use number 3 setting a higher metric for the backup site routes but I am not sure what metric to change Is not the default metric for eigrp 10000 1 255 1 1500 So what would I need to change to make this happen This is what I have in my config currently router eigrp 128 distributelist statictoeigrp out static network 10000 redistribute static metric 10000 1 255 1 1500 passiveinterface default no passiveinterface Vlan364 no passiveinterface Vlan368 eigrp stub connected static summary Thanks RVCE It would be best to increase the value of the delay metric from the default to a higher value HTH Rick RVCE Please can you be more specific what higher value might be and how I would add it into the configThanks RVCE In EIGRP redistribute default metric the second value represents the delay You currently have this redistribute static metric 10000 1 255 1 1500 I would suggest that you change it to this redistribute static metric 10000 100 255 1 1500 HTH Rick RVCE But only want to apply the higher metric to these routes not my whole eigrp redistributionip route 10010024 1020395ip route 10011024 1020395 RVCE If you want to change the metric on some but not all redistributed static routes then you need to use a route map to control your redistribution In one instance of the route map you would match these routes and redistribute with the higher value of delay and in another instance of the route map you would match the remaining routes and redistribute them with the lower value of delay HTH Rick RVCE Please could you provide an example I have yet to use route maps RVCE Hi Here is an example to use to redistribute using routemap routemap STATICTOEIGRP permit 10 match ip address 101 match ip nexthop 10 set metric 100000 100 255 1 1500 exit routemap STATICTOEIGRP permit 20 set metric 100000 1 255 1

Meheretab RVCE I think the simplest way to accomplish this would be to just administratively weigh the statics at the backup site to something higher than the redistributed statics 170 at the primary site So then ip route 10010024 1020395 200 ip route 10011024 1020395 200 As long as the primary routes are active and in the routing table these routes shouldnt propagate Once the primary site is offline the secondary routes would then be advertised RVCE The common way to manipulate redistributed routes is to use route maps The solution suggested by Chris is very creative wish I had thought of it So 5 for it It achieves the desired result without the complexity of using route maps HTH Rick RVCE Thank you Richard I appreciate that RVCE Thank you for your extremely helpful solution and dialogue which give me a better understanding of my network I went with Chriss solution RVCE I am glad that our discussion has been helpful and that you have a better understanding of your network as a result of it The solution from Chris is simple and effective This reminds us that frequently there may be more than one way to solve a problem One of the excellent things about these forums is that we have multiple people looking at the issues and potentially suggesting alternative solutions HTH Rick
Mesh Convergence with WLC 5508  2504 with 1552S Access Points,I have two different setups with WLC 5508 and WLC 2504 with 8 1552S Access Points2 RAPs are connected to the switch  6 MAPs are in 80211a mesh max 2 hopsThe WLC 5508 or WLC 2504 is running with 831330 firmwareMesh Convergence is configured as Very Fast I am observing that whenever I switch OFF one of the RAPs especially the RAP with which all the MAPs have active links during mesh convergence all the MAPs drop from the network even though their inactive link with the other RAP has good SNR they rejoin the network with active links with RAP2 I expect that the mesh convergence should be seamless  the MAPs should not drop when one of the RAPs is switched OFF Can anyone guide me to as what is going wrong Is there any configuration that I have missed Or is this an expected behavior,

QoS  Exchange on MPLS,We recently went through a few upgrades at our CORP center make a long story short we are seeing high bandwidth utilization and latency at remote branch locations when a user opens up their Outlook client to download their mailboxcaching mode is off by defaultThe exchange backend sits at our CORP center which connects to our MPLS 50Mbps the branch however only have a 6Mbps pipe to the MPLS Ive played around with applying a policymap at the branch but I still see high utilization Would one be better off applying a policymap close the Exchange backend before it gets on to the MPLS or does anyone have any suggestions,If your equipment supports it you should have a policy map at both the CORP site and branch sites on devices sending traffic to MPLS On the CORP side you should also shape for the downstream branch bandwidth If the aggregate of your branches can exceed 50 Mbps you may need to shape there tooIf your WAN MPLS is 3rd party you might also investigate what QoS feature they support if any RVCE We only have currently a policymap across all locations is 40 for VOIP traffic Our WAN MPLS provider is using standard QoS markings So if I understand you correctlywe wanted to use 20 of the line for Exchange traffic I would implement a policymap at a remote location with a bandwidth of 6mbps using the following ip accesslist extended EXCHANGE permit ip any host ExchangeServers classmap EXCHANGE match accessgroup name EXCHANGE policymap QoSOUT class EXCHANGE police 1200000 conformaction transmit exceedaction drop On the CORP location use something similar with 20 of the 50mbps line used for Exchange traffic RVCE  Our WAN MPLS provider is using standard QoS markingsOh what standard the RFC What exactly do they do per markingWhat are your devices and their IOS versions being used both at CORP and your branches Could you post what youre using now for policies on both sides
Sticky Sessions on a RV340 MultiWan with Load Balancing Enabled,Does the RV340 support stickypersistent sessions while load balancing over multiple WANs ie once a session is initiated at a web site the router keeps the connection on the same WAN that sent the initial requestMy small business is using an RV340 with multiwanload balancing enabled 2 ISPsWANs precedence  11In this configuration sessions do not persist at many sites where uses log in such as at a financial websites For instance upon enabling load balancing users on our network could no longer log in to our banks web site due to the changing IP addresses violating the security rules of that siteForcing all HTTPS connections to use a particular WAN via PolicyBased Routing is a partial fixworkaround but it is not a true solution since it largely removes the benefit of load balancing esp since nearly all cloudbased services run over TLS nowadays Is there an alternativeOther multiwan routers provide this feature eg UTT routers Am I missing the way that the RV340 facilitates this Solved Go to Solution,After two months worth of running the RV340 in a production environment 15 to 20 active users investigating options testing alternatives and continuing to experience several firmware bugs and hardware problems which is perhaps uncharacteristic for Cisco products I have concluded the following It is not possible to achieve sticky sessions on the current version of the RV340 firmware The RV340 is not quite ready for production I have switched to UTT multiWAN routers which do provide sticky sessions see the identity binding feature on the load balancing menu I have installed and configured both the AC750GW and the AC1220GW models with multiple WAN connections in loadbalanced mode and can attest to their solid performance visavis the buggy performance of the RV340 configured similarly Cisco team if youre listening the lack of the sticky sessions feature is a singular disappointment for those of us who are seeking a loadbalanced multiwan router for use in a small tomedium business office context RVCE I have found a preliminary answer to my sticky sessions question The RV340 uses MWAN3 for load balancing and MWAN3 supports sticky sessions According to the MWAN3 manual load balancing without stickiness enabled can cause problems with HTTPSTLS sessions Mwan3 version 16 has sticky and ipset support Stickiness lets you route new session over the same wan interface as the previous session as long as the time between the new and the previous session is shorter then the timeout value default 600s This can solve some problems with https sites which dont allow a new source address within the same cookiehttps session See subsection Stickiness and ipset The RV340s admin GUI does not currently provide access to MWAN3s stickiness option Cisco team may I request that access to MWAN3s stickiness feature be added to the RV340s GUI RVCE After two months worth of running the RV340 in a production environment 15 to 20 active users investigating options testing alternatives and continuing to experience several firmware bugs and hardware problems which is perhaps uncharacteristic for Cisco products I have concluded the following It is not possible to achieve sticky sessions on the current version of the RV340 firmware The RV340 is not quite ready for production I have switched to UTT multiWAN routers which do provide sticky sessions see the identity binding feature on the load balancing menu I have installed and configured both the AC750GW and the AC1220GW models with multiple WAN connections in loadbalanced mode and can attest to their solid performance visavis the buggy performance of the RV340 configured similarly Cisco team if youre listening the lack of the sticky sessions feature is a singular disappointment for those of us who are seeking a loadbalanced multiwan router for use in a small tomedium business office context
PBR reverse traffic,HelloI have a questionfrom one location ie Site1 I need to separate some traffic from anotherMoreover due to the fact the company has a lot of other offices I have to restrict traffic to choosing OTHER routes could be used due to outages or routing changes Thus the only feasible option is to use special VRF tunnel between Site1 and Site2Traffic selection to VRF tunnel is based on destination host and tcp ports so the traffic from Site1 is now being routed by ASA using static route to destination Then on border router is gets into VLANVRF afterwards goes to tunnel On Site2 traffic comes out of VRF tunnel then I do route leakingip route vrf xxxx yyyy dddd globaland then flows to destination server Now I hit the problem with reverse traffic Originally I was going to put the traffic from GRT back to VRF tunnel using PBR But it doesnt workI see zero hits in ACL and PBR operationMoreover traffic capture shows the traffic is going back from Site2 to Site1 via GRT So PBR applied to incoming reverse traffic from destination server back to Site1 doesnt work at allCan you please advice me why did it happenThank you in advanceBest regards Vladimir Solved Go to Solution,Problem solved PBR works when set vrf—Routes packets through a specified VRF instance The router looks for the outgoing interface in the VRF table Mine mistake was to use initially set ip vrf—Causes the router to look up the next hop in the VRF table RVCE Problem solved PBR works when set vrf—Routes packets through a specified VRF instance The router looks for the outgoing interface in the VRF table Mine mistake was to use initially set ip vrf—Causes the router to look up the next hop in the VRF table

I have question about Nexuss module reload issue,symptom summary 1 same N9K version  703I612 different module deployment  one is N9516 chassis N9KX97160YCEX other is N9516 chassis N9KX9732CEX 3 problem  N9516 chassis that deployed N9KX97160YCEX has suffering modules reload log is EOBC heartbeat failure but N9516 chassis that deployed N9KX9732CEX is normal question  is there any bugs about N9KX97160YCEXs driver or code etc or has anyone same problem just like me,Hi Can you paste the complete log message before reload ThanksVinit RVCE unfortunately I have no logs before reload I have several logs after reload Can you provide your email address because logs are include that business sensitive informations RVCE I had a chance to look at the logs that you shared Based on the logs provided i think it is better to replace the module if the module is reloading continuously If its not reloading  crashing continuously then i would recommend to physically reseat the card jack out and jack in the card Hope this helps ThanksVinit RVCE Hi Lars More than likely you saw something as follows show logging log Timestamp 20171001 075551000000 2017 Oct 1 075551 N9K Oct 1 075551 KERN0SYSTEMMSG 27786873639221 1506844550 EMON module 6 is not responding on EOBC path Reloading module  kernel 2017 Oct 1 075551 N9K MODULE2MODDIAGFAIL Module 6 Serial number XXXXXXXX reported failure due to EOBC heartbeat failure in device DEVEOBCMAC device error 0xc0a1b137 2017 Oct 1 075853 N9K PLATFORM2MODDETECT Module 6 detected Serial number XXXXXXXX ModuleType 48x110GT 4x40G Ethernet Module Model N9KX9564TX 2017 Oct 1 075853 N9K PLATFORM2MODPWRUP Module 6 powered up Serial number XXXXXXXX show module internal exceptionlog Timestamp 20171001 075551000000 Module Slot Number 6 Device Name  eobc System Errorcode  0x4042004e EOBC heartbeat failure Error Type  FATAL error Time  Sun Oct 1 075551 2017 The EOBC is the Ethernet Out of Bounds Channel which is used by the switchs supervisor engine to periodically send keepalive packets to all linecards In some scenarios keepalives can be missed triggering the card to reload If a single heartbeat was missed it will be corrected automatically however when multiple heartbeats are lost simultaneously the supervisor will power off and power on the module in an attempt to resolve the diagnostic issue Typically these issues are a one time occurrence and the module stabilizes on its own postreload from the SUP as you can see in your environment On rare occasions this occurs due to true HW failure caused by multiple parity or uncorrectable errors Id monitor the linecard after reseating it if it did not come back Online on its own If you have multiple occurrences in the future you should then open a TAC case to get it replaced Hope that helps  Andrea  Andrea CCIE 56739 RS RVCE Yes unfortunately if you reboot you will loose The config if its not saved  there is known bugs on certain versions  did you try wr and copy run start  or try and save config to another location so that way after reboot you can transfer file straight back in or last resort use putty capture the whole run config locally and then reapply it Every bug not matter what ID says contact TAC regarding these issues  its a process that gets jammed in most cases and thats why it requires the reboot I would though due to this being a 7K and such a serious effecting bug contact TAC  you dont want to go to all the trouble of rebooting and it doesnt fix it If you reboot active sup and its not saved you loose the config as before switchover config needs to be synced to standby
nat uturn or pbr loopback,Hello team I know this is a topic that is very much discussed but it is simple killing me There are 2 sites 1 with Cisco router 18xx and one with a Vigor3200 one site has teh 1921681024 and the other 9024 as internal IPsNow for SOME reason on the Vigor Side they decided to connect the Cisco with the Vigor thoughout a Switch and as this want enough the decided to put the 19216810 as WAN interface on VIGOR that hits a Provider Modem with Default Gateway or 1254 which is the same network in cisco Fa00 Funny thing they toldthey want these 2 network to communicate with each otherhahahaAs cisco has internal lan 19216810 and Vigor uses the same range in it WAN LOLI dont want to tell them to simple re plan their network I am trying to figure out a Gyro Solution where simple create a Sub interface on Fa00100 as a 10001 and to Vigor Lan2 10002 and somehow put a static route on Vigor that 19216810 is out of 10001 But it wont take it as 1921681024 is used by Vigor in WAN1  But here is what I am thinking Could I create a loopback on Cisco 1111 and static ip route to vigor 1111 from 10001 which it works and pingable but how can I re route the traffic from the Loopback to 19216810 internal Lan of Cisco 16810Lan 19216890lan Vigor 19216810 Wan1 VigorCisco  Switch  Vigor,Hello how are the two sites connected by VPN  What is the WAN IP address of the Cisco side  RVCE This is the most Weid network Topology i have ever seen so far So let me try and explain  Cisco  Comapny 1 Switch Company 1 Computers 1921681024 Vigor Company 2 Cisco Interface 1 inside LAN 1921681024 Vigor To Oxygen Modem 1921681100  Oxygen MOdem 1921681254 Vigor Inside Lan Computers 1921689024 CiscoSwitchVigorOxygen Modem  So because I do not wish to change all of their network and their IPs when I am trying to do is to advertise Cisco network 19216810 to vigor and 19216890 From Vigor to Cisco Network So I created a sub interface on cisco 10001 and an interface on Vigor 10002 I have put a static route on Cisco of 19216890 out of 10002 On Vigor though I cannot Add a static route of 19216810 out of 10001 because it already has a directly connected route to Wan for Oxygen Modem  So I thought why not create a Loopback interface on Cisco and put that as a static route on Vigor So yes a loopback interface with a different Private IP is able to communicate with Company 2 network and the other way around What I am thinking is what if I can somehow make the 19216810 from Cisco PBR route map through out the Loopback interface So 19216890 can reach the Loopback and the loopback can reroute the traffic to 19216810 Cisco is connected through the internet through another Wan Line plus a Dialer as a backup They dont want to use VPN between companies because they say that since it is Directly connected 1 network with the other we could advertise the networks through static routes But they will need to change the Oxygen Modem IP and therefore the Default Gateway Meaning Downtime So what do you think  Confused yet RVCE Hello what device is the layer 3 routing currently configured on at Company 1  You say there is a switch which IP address if the default gateway for the client computers and where is it configured  Company 1 LAN 1921681024    Company 2 RVCE Company 1 has the Cisco which is Connected to a Switch which all their computers are connected which then they connected an interface of that Switch to the Company 2 VigorDefault gateway for the clients is from what I see from configuration 19216811 for Company 1On company 2 some PCs are going out from the Oxygen 1921681100 and some others from different Wan links they enabled Load BalancingAgain it is confusingConnectionsC1 C1 C2CiscoSwitchVigor RVCE Hello So I created a sub interface on cisco

76EST4TG weired lost packet problem on 7609,Dear SirMadam we are using 76EST4TG card in slot 9 and slot 3 91 interface facing core router  32 interface facing customer switch we config a 900 entries ACL on interface 91 incoming direction and protect our customers from attacks now we found some problem we ping directly connected Layer3 neighbor on 7609 is ok but we ping customers under 32 interface from upper layer 3 core router  it lost packets we found packet is send out uper core router to 7609 91 interfacebut some packets not send out 32 interface we ping 100 packet only found 91 packets send out 32 teng interface to customers ios version is supbootdiskc7600rsp72043advipservicesmz12233SRD4bin and we test again on a router directly connected 31 interfacesame slot of interface 32 and no acl config under 31 ping is ok it seems some problem of forwarding problem inside 76EST4TG line card  it is weired thank youTom,Tom it may be that the packets are punted to RP CPU for forwarding Check the HW CEF entry for the destination IP address to see whether its correct You can also try to capture one incoming ping packets from core router using ELAM to see what decision the HW makes For more advanced troubleshooting it would be the best if you could open a TAC SR The IOS release running on this router has reached end of support We suggest upgrading to the latest Safe Harbour release Aleksandar RVCE Hi Aleksandar Thank you for your kindly help sorry for the delay I tested many times recently I send 100 packets from upper router which directly connected to 7609 ES card interface and config acl on the 7609 ES layer 3 interface input direction and I found upper router send 100 packets out  and on 7609 acl hit counts I only found 91 hits so I sniffer on downside port connected to downside server i found 91 packets out to server ad 91 packets came back  So maybe 76 ES card has some bug but I didnt find any match bug i havent capture packet to RP CPU because on ES card interface input direction I found acl hit account indicate es card lost some packets becauset out of contract  I cant open case thank you Tom RVCE Hi Aleksandar Thank you for your kindly help

some packets becauset out of contract  I cant open case thank you Tom RVCE If the ingress ACL on the c7600 side accounts only for 91 packet why do you suspect that its the c7600 that drops the packet Doesnt this test imply that you should also check whats happening on the upstream router RVCE yes we capture packet on upstream switch interface directly connected we found 100 packets send out from upstream router  this is weired there is no crc problem and other interface erros on both interface of 7609 and upstream router may be we need a inline fiber sniffer detector like netcout product this

testing disable the ACLQoS configured on the IF and check the result  Also when you see loss of ICMP packets ping  can you check the output of  show platform hardware drops multiple times to see any drop counters incrementing Best Regards Hari RVCE we can ping directly connected updown switch and router and no packet loss but when we try to ping through from up router to downstream switch it is lost packets we sniffer on interface to downstream router found send 91 packets and returnk 91 packets there no problem from 7609 to downstream switch bug from upstream router we can sniffer 100 packets send out and acl on 7609 only 91 packets received  acl permit hit yestoday  we replaced 9 slot es card but found cant learn mac address directly connected slot 6 device and we reload 7609 whole chassis  the problem has gone now it is ok  but we havent find the reason why lost packet when packet pass through 7609interface layer 3 vlan we cant disable ingress acl on es because customer reason  another new problem we found on this chassis I dont know is this reason related to packet lose we found we run out of aggregate police resource on cisco 7609 customer config many egress

Which DMVPN hub router 85Mbps encrypted traffic,Hello Im looking for advice on a hub router for traffic that bursts above 85Mbps its drops packets during high usage times We currently have a 2951 router and are looking at getting an HSEC license to increase the throughput for our DMVPN tunnel that connects almost 20 small 110 employee branches and a couple of large 2575 employee offices Ive been looking at some documentation but havent found good info on practical throughput of a 2951 with an HSEC license Is it worth it Or should we look into a 4xxx series Thanks,
Counter for DF packets dropped,Hi everyone ive a questione for you if i send a packet with the dont fragment flag in the ip header and the MTU is not as high as the size of the packet eg packet size 2900  MTU 1600 is there a counter that i can see increasing is there any debug that can help me maybe filtering some kind of traffic with ACLsThank you very muchRegards Lorenzo Solved Go to Solution,Hi You can use Debug IP packet details ACL It is commanded to use with ACL with limited test traffic only otherwise it will take a lot of resources of your router Regards Deepak Kumar RVCE Hi You can use Debug IP packet details ACL It is commanded to use with ACL with limited test traffic only otherwise it will take a lot of resources of your router Regards Deepak Kumar
Using a ROUTEMAP in Advertising Networks into BGP  Help needed,Hi all Im looking to use a PrefixList and RouteMap for controlling the networks being advertised into BGP out to an MPLS network Of course I could simply do router bgp 65000network 10100 mask 25525500network 101100 mask 25525500neighbor  However can the networks be put into a PrefixList and RouteMap  I know I can add a RouteMap to a Neighbor xxxxxxxx but Im assuming that this is just filtering the networks without actually advertising them Therefore could I change the network statements to network 10000 mask 255000 and then add 10100 and 101100 to a routemap  Im just looking for a simple and easy way to control subnets being advertised while providing a very descriptive method which will make it very easy for anyone in the future to follow as to what is going on  Solved Go to Solution,Hi How would I best advertise everything in BGP out to the MPLS on the basis that everything in BGP has been redistributed from EIGRP into BGP from the Lan  I am sorry but I am not sure what you are asking about Can you perhaps try rewording your question Either way once routes have been injected into BGP whether through network commands or through redistribute commands they will automatically be advertised from your router to all its BGP peers without further configuration In IOS there is nothing you need to configure on top to get the routes injected into BGP on your router to be advertised further Please feel welcome to ask further Best regardsPeter RVCE Hello The approach of network 10000 mask 255000  would not work because in BGP the network command has to match the networktobeadvertised exactly This is different to IGP protocols where you could configure a large network and all directly connected network falling under it would get advertised However the networks you want to advertise in BGP are already present in your routing table from another source  perhaps directly connected perhaps from an IGP What would typically be done in these cases is a simple redistribution  redistribute connected routemap  or redistribute eigrp 1 routemap  and the referenced routemap would then refer to the ACL or prefixlist that would select the appropriate networks to be advertised So instead of naming the networks one by one you would have them redistributed and in the redistribute command you would use the routemap to pick the routes youre interested in redistributing and thus advertising in BGP Do you think this would be a viable approach for you Best regardsPeter RVCE Thanks for that How would I best advertise everything in BGP out to the MPLS on the basis that everything in BGP has been redistributed from EIGRP into BGP from the Lan  RVCE Hi How would I best advertise everything in BGP out to the MPLS on the basis that everything in BGP has been redistributed from EIGRP into BGP from the Lan  I am sorry but I am not sure what you are asking about Can you perhaps try rewording your question Either way once routes have been injected into BGP whether through network commands or through redistribute commands they will automatically be advertised from your router to all its BGP peers without further configuration In IOS there is nothing you need to configure on top to get the routes injected into BGP on your router to be advertised further Please feel welcome to ask further Best regardsPeter RVCE Sorry to resurrect this again after such a lapse in time Its not working for me at all For instance if I remove the line network 10250102 mask 255255255255then this drops out of the local BGP Topology table and stops advertising router bgp 65000 bgp logneighborchanges neighbor xxxxxxxx remoteas yyyy  addressfamily ipv4 network 101010 mask 2552552550 network 1010110 mask 2552552550 network 10250102 mask 255255255255 router loopback interface redistribute eigrp 100 routemap SENDTOBGP neighbor xxxxxxxx activate neighbor xxxxxxxx routemap NGNMSVCBGPIN in neighbor xxxxxxxx routemap NGNMSVCBGPOUT out exitaddressfamilyip prefixlist SENDTOBGP seq 10 permit 101011024ip prefixlist SENDTOBGP seq 20 permit 10101024ip prefixlist SENDTOBGP seq 30 permit 1025010232routemap NGNMSVCBGPOUT permit 10 match ip address prefixlist SENDTOBGP set aspath prepend 65000 65000 RVCE Hello Not a problem  please apologize my late response Hmmm If removing any network command causes the network to drop out from BGP then the redistribution is not really working as expected obviously Quickly checking your configuration you have posted however I do not see any routemap SENDTOBGP present I see a prefixlist of that name but no routemap Perhaps thats the problem in your configuration Can you try adding this to your config routemap SENDTOBGP permit 10 match ip address prefixlist SENDTOBGP Best regardsPeter RVCE I hadnt realized that I had the routemap pointing at the ip prefixlist However I have fixed that and it still wont work I tried clear ip bgp  soft too but no joy
Problem to upload qcow2 file into Cisco ENCS 5412,Morning I have a cisco ENCS5412 and I fail to load a 12 Gb qcow2 file It is to create a VM packageHow to do this uploading The version of NFVIS is 371 Thanks,Under VM Life Cycle  Image Repository  Image Packaging Click the blue  symbol and it will give you an option to upload your qcow2 and set the options for your package Alternatively you can download the nfvptpy tool from VM Life Cycle  Image Repository  Browse Datastore  Data  intdatastore  Uploads  vmpackagingutility  nfvisvmpackagingtooltar Once you unpack the tarball you can use nfvptpy to package your VM offline and then upload the package which will be in a targz format to the image registration page RVCE the size of the qcow2 file exceeds 6GIts possible RVCE I packaged a 10GB qcow2 offline with the nfvptpy vm packing tool and uploaded the resulting targz to the image repository with no problems RVCE I will try but here is the error that appears
OSPF Authentication,To enable OSPF MD5 authentication is it necessary to run it under all interfaces of a router If I dont enable it under a interface and enable it under router process and rest of the interfaceswill that interfaces network will not be advertised to the rest of the network eg if a LAN switch is connected to an interface on which users are connected and I dont enable authn on that typical interface then ,Its not mandatory that all interface should run authentication even if u have configured under the ospf processbut its mandatory that it must be configured on all neighbors reached through that interfaceotherwise adjacency will not be formedarun RVCE HiHere is an example Sample Configuration for Authentication in OSPF httpwwwciscocomenUStechtk365technologiesconfigurationexample09186a0080094069shtmlIf I understand well your question the answer is The network will be advertised the method for not advertise the network is by route mapthat is a selection of routes that must be advertisedI hope this helpsBest regardsMassimiliano RVCE hiThe authentication type must be the same for all routers and access servers in an area The authentication password for all OSPF routers on a network must be the same if they are to communicate with each other via OSPF Use the ip ospf authenticationkey interface command to specify this passwordIf you enable MD5 authentication with the messagedigest keyword you must configure a password with the ip ospf messagedigestkey interface commandTo remove the authentication specification for an area use the no form of this command with the authentication keywordYou typically enable authentication for a area not for specific interfaceThe authentication affects the communication between the routers of the authenticated areanot between the users and switchesHTHregardsshri  RVCE Hi Im facing issues between IOS XR and IOS XE for OSPF AUTH In IOS XE there is only init state for IOS XR in debug I only see the Hello Packets Have you any idea I verified using the same MD5 key in both nodesRegards RVCE Hello do you have are or interface authentication configured

more than voip phones and thinclients for RDP traffic to the main office using a 50Mb lineThis config is running a few years now made by somebody who left the company but i have heard from the users that there always were voip quality problemsI post the config file and hope you can give me some insights in if I can improve the setup which in general must be very basic so just act as a branch router for using RDP clients and voip dataHope to hear some dos and donts and off course the no gos in this config Building configurationCurrent configuration  16396 bytesversion 124no service

venture to say your QoS might be a bit suboptimalFirst understand for QoS to be most effective it often needs an egress configuration on both sides of a link Second if an interface provides more physical bandwidth than is known to be available along the path you also need to shape for the available bandwidthYour service policies allocate 75 of the bandwidth for PQ Cisco recommends you dont exceed 33 for PQ Some of the traffic thats being sent to PQ shouldnt go there RVCE Hi Can you share the output from show policymap int f00 out and show policymap int f01 out we would like to see if you have any VOIP matches httpswwwciscocomcenussupportdocsqualityofserviceqosqoscongestionavoidance10107showpolicyhtml Regards Alex Please rate useful posts RVCE Hi Alex Used your commands but I get 0

to use a hierarchal poliicy with shaper Also I believe many Cisco shapers and policers dont account for L2 overhead and if your device doesnt you also want to shape about 15 slower than your nominal

on the most effective qos for my branch  branch has 66 Employees thanks all RVCE What I suggested in my first post should be effective again though you may want to reduce the shapers CIR by about 15As to most effective theres insufficient information RVCE Hello joseph I dont see you added class for SQL aka DB and Application with necessary Bandwidth reservation  if i the branch got congested somehow then users wont be able to make transaction to DB and APP at HQ  thus customers will be angry from delay of service thanks RVCE Correct and as I posted earlierNB you can include DBAPAccess class but with FQ in classdefault you may not need itFQ often does a nice job of insuring flows obtain the bandwidth they need With it you often dont need additional classes However additional classes could be used if you really need a different set of SLA parametersFurther sometimes rather than providing something better you provide something worse for bandwidth hogging traffic So for example rather than placing your SQL DB into its own class you might place something like backup traffic into a scavenger like class with a minimal bandwidth allocation RVCE Hi what do u mean bro by the below  i dint get you specially Backup  you might place something like backup traffic into a scavenger like class  thanks RVCE BackupHost backups ie overthenet backups of user PCs and servers RVCE  RVCE Hi Joseph policymap SampleParentclass classdefaultshape average 10000000 is this the 10Mbps i got from fiber provider the Physical interface is 1 GiG on cisco 2911servicepolicy SampleChild RVCE shape average 10000000 is this the 10Mbps i got from fiber providerYes it is However again I believe many Cisco shapers dont count L2 overhead but providers generally do If both are true then you need to set a lower shaped value to allow for it Unfortunately the overhead as a percentage varies on overall packet size Generally 15 accounts for about the average overhead RVCE Thanks buddy  i marked as

OSPF Router LSAType 1 LSA,I am studying Router LSAType 1 LSA I know for different neighbors Type 1 LSA will give different InformationA Interface with no neighbors I have implemented with connecting R1 to a switch 1 When there is no neighbor R1 will send Hello but it would not receive a response to its Hello hence it terms this link as STUB network So my question is why it is termed as STUB network and for this STUB network it would give information as Link Id Networkhere in this scenario 19216830 and Link datasubnet maskhere in the scenario of the screenshot attached Link Data 2552552550 Why STUB network gives Network and subnet information B Interface with DRWhy this link is termed as TRANSIT And why it gives Link Id DR IP and Link DataInterface why it doesnt give network and subnet mask C Interface without DRHere it has 2 links one point to point and one STUB networkSTUB is to know network and subnet mask as there is no DR Why it gives totally different information and then needs STUB network it could have included in the point to point link description directlyPlease clarify for the above mentioned behavior for these 3 types of interface in Router LSAType 1 LSA I am attaching a sample topology with the router LSA outputThanks In advance Solved Go to Solution,Hi Ravi why it is termed as STUB network It is because as far as OSPF concerned this stub network is a dead end  packets can enter this network but they cannot get to any other network from there Remember  a stub network is a network in which the OSPF router has no neighbors so it can be reasonably assumed that there are no more routers so there is nothing behind that network The term stub is typically used in networking to denote a dead end property  you can reach the object with this property but there is nothing behind this object  you cannot proceed from that object to any other place Why STUB network gives Network and subnet information Keep in mind that the Type1 LSA or LSA1 always indicates a connection or a link of the originating router to an object in the network OSPF recognizes four types of such connections pointtopoint links to neighboring routers always pointing to the OSPF RID of the other neighbor transit links always pointing to the IP address of the DR in the transit network links to stub networks carrying the subnet addressnetmask information directly virtual links always pointing to the OSPF RID of the faraway router With a stub network in particular there is no other router in it to indicate a link to therefore the only option to describe a stub network is to state its network and netmask right away Why this link is termed as TRANSIT And why it gives Link Id DR IP and Link DataInterface why it doesnt give network and subnet mask Broadcast and nonbroadcast networks that contain two and more routers are considered transit networks because you can enter them through one router and exit them through any other router Packets may be just transiting these networks being passed from one router to another but their final destination may be elsewhere  hence the adjective transit The information about the transit networks address and netmask is contained in the Network LSA Type2 LSA or LSA2 which is originated by that networks DR Member routers of a transit network use their LSA1 to point to the DRs LSA2 and the LSA2 in turn contains the addressing information for this network and points back to individual member routers You can consider this to be a sort of optimization as the addressnetmask information about the transit network will be contained only in the single LSA2 as opposed to being repeated in each member routers LSA1 There are also other reasons for the existence of LSA1 and LSA2  more fundamental and more involved  but for our initial discussion it is safe to stay at this level Here it has 2 links one point to point and one STUB networkSTUB is to know network and subnet mask as there is no DR Why it gives totally different information and then needs STUB network it could have included in the point to point link description directly This is a specific property of OSPF that has proven to be quite confusing over time  indeed a pointtopoint connection to another OSPF router is described using two link entries in the routers LSA1 First a pointtopoint link to the neighboring router and a stub network entry describing the IP networknetmask used on this link The reason for this is the need to support unnumbered pointtopoint connections in OSPF An unnumbered pointtopoint connection would be described as a single pointtopoint link in each routers LSA1 pointing to the OSPF RID of the other router without any addressing information Consequently a numbered pointtopoint connection is essentially described as two entries A pointtopoint link to the neighboring router just like an unnumbered connection and a stub network entry describing the IP network on the pointtopoint connection Regarding this particular topic you might be interested in reading through the following thread httpssupportforumsciscocomt5lanswitchingandroutingospftermonilogystubnetworktdp2074689 Feel welcome to ask further Best regardsPeter RVCE Hi Ravi why it is termed as STUB network It is because as far as OSPF concerned this stub network is a dead end  packets can enter this network but they cannot get

that networks DR Member routers of a transit network use their LSA1 to point to the DRs LSA2 and the LSA2 in turn contains the addressing information for this network and points back to individual member routers You can consider this to be a sort of optimization as the addressnetmask information about the transit network will be contained only in the single LSA2 as opposed to being repeated in each member routers LSA1 There are also other reasons for the existence of LSA1 and LSA2  more fundamental and more involved  but for our initial discussion it is safe to stay at this level Here it has 2 links one point to point and one STUB networkSTUB is to know network and subnet mask as there is no DR Why it gives totally different information and then needs STUB network it could have included in the point to point link description directly This is a specific property of OSPF that has proven to be quite confusing over time  indeed a pointtopoint connection to another OSPF router is described using two link entries in the routers LSA1 First a pointtopoint link to the neighboring router and a stub network entry describing the IP networknetmask used on this link The reason for this is the need to support unnumbered pointtopoint connections in OSPF An unnumbered pointtopoint connection would be described as a single pointtopoint link in each routers LSA1 pointing to the OSPF RID of the other router without any addressing information Consequently a numbered pointtopoint connection is essentially described as two entries A pointtopoint link to the neighboring router just like an unnumbered connection and a stub network entry describing the IP network on the pointtopoint connection Regarding this particular topic you might be interested in reading through the following thread httpssupportforumsciscocomt5lanswitchingandroutingospftermonilogystubnetworktdp2074689 Feel welcome to ask further Best regardsPeter RVCE Thanks a lot Peter Paluch for the detailed answer to my question Other question related to different topic regarding DR BDR election Suppose I have 3 routers in same multiaccesstransit network and all of them have priority 0 which would mean all 3 would not take part in the DR BDR election So what would happen in this scenario They would stop at 2Way stateIf they are in 2way how this would affect the topology and what would be the end result RVCE Hi Ravi My apologies for responding so late Suppose I have 3 routers in same multiaccesstransit network and all of them have priority 0 which would mean all 3 would not take part in the DR BDR election So what would happen in this scenario All three routers will remain in a mutual 2Way state None of the neighbors will form a full adjacency to any other router on this transit network As a result they will not synchronize their linkstate databases over this transit network and they all will treat the network as a stub network not leading anywhere In other words OSPF will behave as if the network never really interconnected the three routers together Feel welcome to ask further Best regardsPeter RVCE Thanks for the reply Could you please elaborate the process of DR BDR election in detail I dont understand the process of DR BDR election it confuses me For example If there are 2 routersR1R2 if I configure OSPF first on R2 then R2 becomes DR So what is the point of DR BDR election when it is like whichever router we configure OSPF first that becomes DRAlso i was reading BDR is elected firstwhy is that BDR is elected first I was reading OSPF from Routing TCPIP vol 1 and it says that After twoway communication has been established with one or more neighbors examine the Priority DR and BDR fields of each neighbors Hello List all routers eligible for election that is routers with priority greater than 0 and whose neighbor state is at least twoway all routers declaring themselves to be the DR their own interface address is in the DR field of the Hello packet and all routers declaring themselves to be the BDR their own interface address is in the BDR field of the Hello packet The calculating router will include itself on this list unless it is ineligibleSo my question is before the election here we see that some routers say they are DR and BDR What would happen if all the routers declare them as DR Also who becomes the calculating router RVCE Hi Ravito keep things simple and clear consider that when a router start to announce itself on a transit link thus broadcast or non broadcast network it initially tries to announce itself as DR There is a waittimer that stands by default to 40 seconds which is used by the new announcing DR to wait and listen if more recent DR where already present on the segment If the new router doesnt hear for any Ospf packet of a preceding DR then it elects itself as a DRThis is also why the adjacency formation last longer on transit links than on p2p links Therefore you may want also to account for this when you want speed up convergence on your domainTechnically this is a security mechanism to ensure that when a new router appears on a segment even though it has a higher priority or equal priority but higher addressing scheme that router cannot preempt an existing DR If this would happen you could end with two DRs on the same segment determining an inconsistency in the Ospf database In Ospf preemption of the DR may occur just in isolate and builted ad hoc config cases but in generally its not admitted by the protocolFor other protocols like ISIS for example which is link state protocol as well preemption of the DR is possible but you may have heard it called by a different name such as DIS RVCE Hi Peter Paluch Could you please elaborate more on this if possible I would like to know more about the reasons of existence of LSA1 and LSA2  which are more fundamental and more involvedThere are also other reasons for the existence of LSA1 and LSA2  more fundamental and more involved Thanks in advanceBest Regards Ravi
Access Control List issue Range cannot contact a certain host,We have implemented a new test system on our network we have created SVIs with a IP range to have a 24 The following is an example of the format we have The one machine and range in question are in two seperate vlans Below is a configuration example of what we have in there now VLAN 38 ip accesslist ext 2138 in10 permit ip xxxx380 000255 host xxxx21254 ip accesslist ext 138 out10 permit ip host xxxx21254 xxxx380 000255 we cannot ping from the 254 box to a box on the 380 network is this the right format to allow communication with each other,What platform is this configured for Please provide the configuration at least of the two interfaces involved so that we can better evaluate what you are configuring HTH Rick RVCE Could you ping before you applied the ACLs IOW  could it be a routing issue
Pls advise on auto QOS on cisco 3750X  Acts as Access Switches where users are connected  and 2911  for Branch router,Hello Guys Greeting of the Day Pls advise on auto QOS on cisco 3750X  Acts as Access Switches where users are connected and 2911  for Branch router  thanks to cisco  auto QOS is such a tasty cake   save lots of reading Thanks all,If you are using Cisco phones auto QoS should not be a problem Ive used it and it does greatly simplify things Regards RVCE If your applications needs are such that whatever a particular devices autoQoS meets them then autoQoS is fine BTW if a devices current autoQoS implementation doesnt serve your needs maybe Ciscos next autoQoS variant willIf you understand QoS sufficiently to understand whether autoQoS is serving your needs you probably then understand it well enough you dont need it If you dont understand it that well then you take the chance of either autoQoS being suboptimal or perhaps even adverse to your trafficIf your only real need for QoS is to support VoIP then autoQoS is likely not to be adverse NB the first autoQoS implementations were only to help VoIP although on a 3750 enabling any QoS at all may also increase drops RVCE thanks all

General Question on QoS,Hi everyone The QoS is my week point and I want to clarify ASP Here are some stupid questions that I want to answer from you as you are expert of Cisco and QOS magic 1 Is it compulsory to start marking voice traffic from IP Phone2 If IP phone is not marked traffic than how to access switch identify the traffic for marking3 If I am not configured QoS on Access switch but it is applied to Core switch and WAN router Is it beneficial for me Sorry in advance for these stupid questions RegardsDeepak Kumar,Hi Deepak First things first  Please do not apologize for asking and do not call your questions stupid These forums are here to answer exactly these types of questions I will try to answer your questions to the best of my knowledge but I sincerely hope that Joe Doherty also joins this thread and shares his view since I consider Joe to be an authority on this topic  sincerely 1 Is it compulsory to start marking voice traffic from IP Phone This depends on what your goals and needs are Without marking certain traffic differently it will not be treated differently in the network  it as simple as that If your network is overprovisioned with bandwidth and hardly has any congestion packet drops or excessive buffering marking the voice traffic is not going to make much difference because the queuing mechanisms that give preferential treatment to certain traffic classes wont kick into action anyway But if you do have choke points in network places where traffic starts to be queued potentially even being dropped due to congestion then marking the voice traffic is absolutely required to make it stand out Of course I did not emphasize it before since it seems to be so natural but it is likely good to call it out Your network must be configured to recognize different markings and to give them appropriate treatment Marking traffic by different DSCP values is not going to have any effect if the network itself ignores these markings 2 If IP phone is not marked traffic than how to access switch identify the traffic for marking There are not many options  switches typically have limited features to identify types of traffic One of the simplest approaches would be to be define a twostage policy using ACLs All traffic coming from the phones IP address and destined to a known TCPUDP port for signalling SIP SIPS SCTP would be recognized as signalling and assigned the DSCP value of AF41 for example All other traffic coming from the phones IP address would be treated as media and assigned the DSCP value of EF 3 If I am not configured QoS on Access switch but it is applied to Core switch and WAN router Is it beneficial for me This very much depends on where the congestion occurs If there is no congestion on the access layer then the QoS mechanisms would likely not do anything anyway There is a simple rule to remember though The moment you have a congestion even on a single network device and that device does not honor QoS markings you have essentially nullified your whole QoS policy since that device will treat all traffic in the same way and not treat the important flows preferentially exactly when they needed it the most Feel welcome to ask further Best regardsPeter RVCE its not compulsory to mark at the phone at all its just much simpler to do it this way in a cisco Uc deployment where your cucm basically tells the phone which dscp values to use for videovoice and signalling if you just tell your switch to trust these values than you do need to apply all sorts of acl on your routerswitch to define this sort of traffic Please remember to rate useful posts by clicking on the stars below RVCE 1 No its not as noted by Dennis2 It can be identified in various other ways As also noted by both Peter and Dennis3 As Peter describes it really depends whether theres congestion more specifically whether theres enough congestion that its adverse to the service needs of the applications and also whether QoS can provide the service levels required As you also specifically asked about a WAN router the foregoing still holds but its often one of the most common places youll see congestion going from a LAN to a WAN as often the latter supports less bandwidthBTW for number 1 marking traffic is really for efficiency It allow devices to quickly analyze a packets service requirements by examination of a single byte Again you dont need to mark packets to analyze them and further just because a packet is marked doesnt always mean it will be subject to analysis and given any different service treatment Also understand if packets are marked they might also be remarked along the wayAlso BTW when traffic ingresses a network QoS trust boundary already marked its often a good idea to somehow verify the marking is valid for the traffic

Raimund Schimanovits from Cisco Support Community App RVCE I am concerned about the answer to remove the second boot command I do not see any issues with the syntax of the boot command but something is preventing booting the first image If we remove the second boot command without identifying the reason why the first command is not working it could have an unfortunate resultThere are a couple of things that commonly could cause this result so I suggest that you check these things to see if one of them is the cause of this behavior does the 1841 have enough memory to run the 1511T code does the 1511T image really exist in flash and is the name spelled exactly correctlyIf the problem does not seem to be one of the above issues then I suggest that you establish a console session making sure that console logging is enabled and then boot the router Capture all of the console output during the boot process and post it There is probably some message in the output that will identify what the issue is with booting 1511THTHRick RVCE I agree with Richard In this situation you want to be really safeHave you tried running a verify on this ios imageRun the following command and post the

Updating DMVPN encryption protocols,Hello I am looking for advice on updating our DMVPN hub and spoke routers with new encryption and hashing protocols Id like to update them to My main question is is there a way to automatically have the spokes renegotiate their tunnels using the new transform set and and ipsec profile that has been added The steps below are what I have so far If its not possible to have the spokes automatically switch over what would be the best way to update 20 DMVPN devices Is there anything else I should consider when making this change Thanks for any help Hub configuration Spoke configuration Solved Go to Solution,These are different clouds then modify one make sure its up and running and routing is ok then modify the primarily Down time will be very very short doing that way ThanksFrancescoPS Please dont forget to rate and select as validated answer if this answered your question RVCE Hi You cant remove the old profile and get the tunnel taking the new profile without configuring it You need by anyways to apply the new profile under the tunnel interface configuration Here you dont have a lot of solutions Do you have ssh access to all routes over the wan interface If so you can schedule a maintenance window and push all configs using a script If you have dynamic routing on all sites you can create a new dmvpn cloud new tunnel interfaces using the new profile When this new cloud is up and running you can shutdown old tunnels The impact will be less if all routing learned new ip addresses ThanksFrancescoPS Please dont forget to rate and select as validated answer if this answered your question RVCE Thank you for the suggestion setting up a new DMVPN cloud alongside the existing one seems to be the safest way to configure this We do have dynamic routing enabled between all sites using EIGRP This seems like a really interesting idea I guess there would be no problem setting up multiple DMVPN tunnels on single source interface We currently have a primary and secondary tunnel for most sites so this method would add two more Do you know if there would be any issue with conflicting configurations on the hub or spoke after adding a second DMVPN cloud RVCE Adding a new cloud which means network of is different from the other one you wont have any issues You already have 2 tunnels The second one you called backup how is it configured When Ill have your config for those secondary tunnel i will validate or not if you can do the following Depending on their config you can maybe leverage The second one as active with the new profile and when theyll be up you will change the first tunnel Can you share your tunnel config for hub and 1 spoke to see those 2 tunnels ThanksFrancescoPS Please dont forget to rate and select as validated answer if this answered your question RVCE Ahhh thats an excellent idea too Configs for our hub and spoke are below We have the primary tunnel going to our main datacenter and secondary going to out backup site We actually have two primary tunnels headed to our main datacenter most locations only use one tunnel locations with two ISPs use both I believe Spoke  crypto ipsec

the suggestion Will be trying it out On another note would both DMVPN clouds share the same routes Im wondering how I could verify that the two clouds are the same in terms of routing RVCE Based on your config therere all part of EIGRP AS 1 If you issue show ip eigrp neighbor from HUB you can see the peering with spokes if you kept eigrp config as its basic config Or if you issue show ip route eigrp you should see Tunnel 10 subnets into RIB ThanksFrancescoPS Please dont forget to rate and select as validated answer if this answered your question RVCE Although on both ends of a DMVPN tunnel you should be able to rank which IPSec profile will be used first I recall an existing session will continue to use what its using until it has to start a new session Ie shutting the tunnel or clearing the crypto session would be required
