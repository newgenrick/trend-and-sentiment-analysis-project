ASA to Router config,Im currently studying for CCNA Security so I purchased an ASA 5520 to integrate into my home network I currently have a 3845 router with Firewall set up I am using a portmap and NAT at the moment to allow remote desktop and access to my Plex video server What is normalbest practice for Router config headed to ASA Not sure if I should be forwarding all traffic from the router to the ASA and let it handle all the firewall functions or do I leave the router as it is and make rules at both the router  ASA for any traffic coming from the outside that I want to allow in Any thoughts would be extremely helpful Im planning to put it inline Thanks Solved Go to Solution,I personally like to terminate Internet circuits on a router I like this because the router routes better than an ASA You can also configure some features such as QoS Shaping on the Router which is not supported on the ASAs Technically shaping is supported on the nonX ASA models but those are EoLEoS so you should be looking to an X series If you do that then the Router will be your choke device This is where you can configure some basic ACLs to prevent IP spoofing RFC 1918 etc You can also run ZBF Zonebased Firewall but that requires the security license on the router For NAT If you only have a single public IP then the router will do your NATPAT If you have a block of IPs then you can move that functionality to the ASA but it is not needed The ASA is very flexible and powerful when it comes to NAT but if you only have one IP then the NAT function can live on your router Overall I like the approach of letting the Router route and the ASA to be Firewall I hope this helps Thank you for rating helpful posts RVCE I personally like to terminate Internet circuits on a router I like this because the router routes better than an ASA You can also configure some features such as QoS Shaping on the Router which is not supported on the ASAs Technically shaping is supported on the nonX ASA models but those are EoLEoS so you should be looking to an X series If you do that then the Router will be your choke device This is where you can configure some basic ACLs to prevent IP spoofing RFC 1918 etc You can also run ZBF Zonebased Firewall but that requires the security license on the router For NAT If you only have a single public IP then the router will do your NATPAT If you have a block of IPs then you can move that functionality to the ASA but it is not needed The ASA is very flexible and powerful when it comes to NAT but if you only have one IP then the NAT function can live on your router Overall I like the approach of letting the Router route and the ASA to be Firewall I hope this helps Thank you for rating helpful posts RVCE Thanks for the thorough and quick reply Let me make sure Im understanding correctly So I dont necessarily need the firewall on the router at all since its function is really to protect whats on the other side and I would be routing all traffic to the ASA The routers protection will live in properly configured AAA yesno Thanks again RVCE Yes as long as the router is properly securedhardened Here is a good Cisco guide to hardening IOS httpwwwciscocomcenussupportdocsipaccesslists1360821html Thank you for rating helpful posts RVCE Awesome thank you RVCE You are welcome Glad I could help

ASA 82 code and static nats,So quick and easy question I hopei have a asa configured on an internal network and I see that theres a static statement for each interface combination but its just saying nat the ip to itself which seems to be pointlessAre these statements even needed I know you always need NAT route rule but this seems ridiculousstatic insideoutside 0000 0000 netmask 255255255255static insidewarehouse 0000 0000 netmask 255255255255static warehouseinside 0000 0000 netmask 255255255255static nowhereinside 0000 0000 netmask 255255255255,Hiseems strange configuration did you inherit this configuration from another security engineer RVCE Yes its strange I did inherit it A sh nat shows no translatehits for any of them so I think its safe to remove it but I have hundreds of asas with this statement so before removing it I want to make certain I understand why its doing Im trying to get the config ready to upgrade to 84 therefore I want to eliminate any erroneous code

to Solution,Actually the answer is that no you should not be able to ping the other vlan interfaces of the ASA As part of its basic security policy the ASA does not allow ping from a device connected in one interface to the other interfaces of the ASA HTH Rick RVCE I do not see an obvious issue in the config that you posted When I saw several interfaces at the same security level I wondered if that might be an issue but I see that you have both of the samesecuritylevel commands So that is not the issue I wondered if it might be a NAT issue But you are only doing NAT for traffic going through the outside interface So that is not an issue Are devices in these subinterfaces able to access the Internet Would you post the output of show arp HTH Rick RVCE Hi Rick Thanks for your answer I am able to reach the internet on the different sub interfaces yes Here is the output of show arp fw01config show arp mgmt 10099101 406c8f51edc2 387 mgmt 10099100 406c8f51edc2 8237 adm 1001012 406c8f51edc2 117 RVCE Thanks for the additional information It does verify that the interfaces and subinterfaces are working and that the default gateway of the hosts does get traffic to the ASA And it does confirm that the ASA sees multiple devices in your network But I notice something very strange that all of the devices inside the network seem to have exactly the same mac address of 406c8f51edc2 So perhaps we need to understand better what is connected to the ASA and to these devices HTH Rick RVCE That Mac adress is my laptop I have tried to connect to both adm and mgmt vlan RVCE Thanks for the clarification If your laptop is the only device that the ASA sees do I assume that it is the only device active in the network Or are there other devices that do not show up in the arp table If there is only a single device connected then communication between subinterfaces is not going to happen who would it communicate with If there are other devices but they do not show up in the arp table then we need to figure out what is causing this HTH Rick RVCE Rick I agree on this but shouldnt i be able to ping the other interfaces From vlan 99 100991 i cannot ping vlan 10 100101 interface and vlan 50 100501 interface RVCE Actually the answer is that no you should not be able to ping the other vlan interfaces of the ASA As part of its basic security policy the ASA does not allow ping from a device connected in one interface to the other interfaces of the ASA HTH Rick RVCE Ah i did not know this Thanks for clearing this up Rick Just for curiosity is it possible to enable this RVCE As far as I know this policy can not be changed I do not know of any config option that can change this behavior HTH Rick RVCE Rick Thank you so much for your help RVCE You are quite welcome

traffic then it should be possible to simply configure an extended access list with a permit ip any any and assign that ACL in on the outside interface That is not a typical approach on an ASA but the ASA is usually functioning as a firewall If you basically want just an SLA monitor it seems this should work HTH Rick RVCE I do not believe that you need to apply the access list on the inside interface and suggest that you remove accessgroup 101 out interface inside Also the access list permits echoreply but not echo So the attempt to ping from the client will be denied Another issue is your default route route inside 0000 0000 1023151 1 But this route should use interface outside and not inside Make these changes and let us know if the behavior changes HTH Rick RVCE Thank you for the response Rick I made the changes that you suggested and I am still unable to ping and there is no communication via UDP from between client and server So just to clarify I am attempting to allow UDP traffic in either direction as well as pings I have worked with ACLs one time before years ago and it was very basic so it would be safe to assume I know almost nothing on the subject RVCE Could you add an inspect for ICMP This would go under class inspectiondefault Could you also post the output of the command show arp Could you enable logging buffered and then when you are attempting to send from client to server look in the logs and see what might be there about the connection attempt HTH Rick RVCE Hey Rick Sorry I am so green to this Here is the show ARP command routeswitchconfigpmap sho arp inside 192168316 6469bc04dfbf 41 inside 192168310 a0b3cc23da1e 261 outside 1023159 6469bc04e8cb 10 I am unsure what commands to run to add an inspect for ICMP I will see if I can google that one up real quick I also turned on logging so once I find the log I will let you know what I find on the connection attempt RVCE Okay I have turned on Inspect ICMP and have checked the log there are no messages in the buffered log RVCE I had hoped that there would be helpful information in the logs but if there is not then we will take a different approach to this issue I suggest that for now we focus on traffic initiated from the server on the inside interface to the client on the outside interface The traffic from inside to outside should be permitted and any response to that traffic should be permitted So what happens if you attempt a ping from the server to the client HTH Rick RVCE I am able to ping the client from the inside interface RVCE Is there any way to set this up as passing any and all traffic through When these devices go live on the network the ASA is pretty much going to be just an SLA monitor point RVCE If you want to pass all traffic then it should be possible to simply configure an extended access list with a permit ip any any and assign that ACL in on the outside interface That is not a typical approach on an ASA but the ASA is usually functioning as a firewall If you basically want just an SLA monitor it seems this should work HTH Rick RVCE Well I was playing around with the settings here and I have found that if I set the outside security level higher than the inside the UDP traffic flows no problem The server and client can talk both ways Thank you for all of your help rick I will be putting this in place on Wednesday and will post just to let you know how the cutover goes RVCE I am glad that you figured out a way to get it to work On an ASA traffic initiated from a higher level interface is always allowed to a lower level interface and response traffic is always allowed So when you make the outside interface level higher than the inside interface then the UDP traffic would flow to the server and response traffic would flow back While it is an unusual config on an ASA to have the outside interface a higher level than the inside interface it works in your situation It would also have worked to get UDP traffic from the client to the server to configure an access list that permitted the traffic from outside to inside But if you have a config that works it may not be worth the effort to get a different way to get it to work Please do post back and let us know how it does as you put it into production HTH Rick

ASA  INTERVLAN ROUTING DESIGN,I have 2 ASA 5512X with FP services and i would like to add a dmz network for another company My question here isBoth ASAs will connect to the layer 3 switchLayer 3 switch will have 3 vlans vlan2 for users vlan3 for servers and vlan4 for management Layer3 switch will be connected with several layer2 switches via trunk linksFor the link between layer3 switch and ASAs should i create a seperate vlan and add the ports as access portsIf yes if i add WCCP for WSA should the WSA be on the same vlan as ASAs inside ip address If yes the default route for the switch should be the inside interface of ASA If yes i should add static routes to the ASA so that users from another zone would be able to access the new network Thanks in advance Solved Go to Solution,You tell us about two ASA5512 with FP services but you do not tell us whether these will be configured and operate as a failover pair or as two independent ASA Can you clarify You mention the ASAs and layer 3 switches But you do not indicate whether you intend to do the inter vlan routing on the layer 3 switch or on the ASA This would make a difference in what you configure My suggestion would be to do inter vlan routing on the layer 3 switch and just pass traffic to the ASA that needs access to outside If you do inter vlan routing on the layer 3 switch then you would want to make the connection from the switch to ASA as an access port with a separate vlan If you want to do inter vlan routing on ASA then the switch connection needs to be a trunk If you choose to do WCCP the WSA should be on the same vlan as the inside interface Yes the default route for the switch should use the ASA inside interface IP address as the next hop I do not understand your question about another zone Can you provide clarification HTH Rick RVCE You tell us about two ASA5512 with FP services but you do not tell us whether these will be configured and operate as a failover pair or as two

not understand your question about another zone Can you provide clarification HTH Rick RVCE Hi Richard and thank you for you reply Both ASAs are on ActiveStandby mode Intervlan routing will be performed on the layer 3 switch So since ASAs will be on a different VLAN both inside interfaces from the users and the servers and since i would use wccp you are saying that my WSA has to be on the same vlan as the ASAs  VLAN2ASA VLAN  1921681024 VLAN3USERS VLAN  1921682024 VLAN4SERVERS VLAN  1921683024 VLAN5MGMT VLAN  1921684024 Thanks RVCE Thanks for confirming that the ASAs will be configured as activestandby failover pair and that routing will be done on the layer 3 switch So both of the ASAs and the layer 3 switch would have interfaces and IP addresses in vlan 2 The ASA would have route statements for the subnets of vlans 3 and 4 and 5 with the next hop being the layer 3 switch address but would not have any active involvement in those vlans I need to change what I said about WCCP With WCCP the ASA needs to use the same interface to reach users and the WSA And in this design that would be the case The WSA could be in the same vlan as users and not necessarily in the vlan that connects the switch and the ASAs HTH Rick RVCE Thank you Richard One more question In case i configure another vlan for users VLAN6 where will WSA be  RVCE You had indicated that vlan 3 would be for users Now you are suggesting that vlan 6 will be for users I am not clear whether you are suggesting that there will be two vlans for users both 3 and 6 or whether vlan 6 replaces vlan 3 If it is replacement then it is simple and WSA is in the new vlan for users If both vlans will be used then you choose which one you want the WSA to be in HTH Rick RVCE Richard Let me explain Lets say i create the following vlans VLAN2ASA VLAN  1921681024 VLAN3USERS VLAN  1921682024 VLAN4SERVERS VLAN  1921683024 VLAN5MGMT VLAN  1921684024 VLAN6GUESTS VLAN  1921685024 and i want to filter all outgoing internet traffic with WSA with wccp protocol Where should i place WSA  Thank you RVCE Let me begin by being clear that while I am familiar with WSA that this is not a particular area of strength for me So there might be some in the forum who are more expert with this and might suggest something a bit different But based on what I know about WCCP I would put it into one of the vlans on the layer 3 switch perhaps the management vlan The WSA certainly does not need to be directly connected to the ASA HTH Rick
Very wierd NATPAT pool exhausted but only on standby firewall,HiI have a pair of ASA5520s running 847 with the standby logging NATPAT pool exhausted Unable to create connection the active ASA does not log the same messageI dont understand why the standby is logging anything is this a bug,Try running these 2 commands in the CLI on primary and standby show conn count show xlate count If you have numbers here approaching 64000 then you have an indicator of NATPAT exhaustion In my experience numbers past about 44k caused issues probably due to momentary spikes of 20000 pretty easy to accomplish especially with a malfunctioning device RVCE Hi I have just gone back to this issue as it is still there see below there are nowhere near 65000 connection Jun 30 2016 155937 ASA3202010 NATPAT pool exhausted Unable to create connection Jun 30 2016 155937 ASA3210007 LU allocate xlate failed Jun 30 2016 155944 ASA3202010 NATPAT pool exhausted Unable to create connection Jun 30 2016 155944 ASA3210007 LU allocate xlate failed fw sh xlate count 15125 in use 31336 most used fw sh conn count 13556 in use 17227 most used fw term mon Jun 30 2016 160057 ASA3202010 NATPAT pool exhausted Unable to create connection Jun 30 2016 160057 ASA3210007 LU allocate xlate failed Jun 30 2016 160059 ASA3202010 NATPAT pool exhausted Unable to create connection Jun 30 2016 160059 ASA3210007 LU allocate xlate failed Jun 30 2016 160101 ASA3202010 NATPAT pool exhausted Unable to create connection RVCE  Both units have the same configuration any change on the standby that was not replicated  Can you run a packet tracer on the active and one on the standby dont replicate configs yet  Please attach the outputs RVCE Got this problem too only on 5545X and 917 any updates on this one

ASA 5505 with Comcast,HelloI was hoping someone had some input here I have an SBG6580 modemrouter in bridge mode with a router to it so I can use my own router AE Extreme Anyway I have port 00 into the modem and have AE Extreme into port 01 of the ASA I have tried multiple setups Setup static routes inside any to modem gateway My biggest confusion on the ASA in how the insideoutside interface should be properly setup Should I need static routes If you need more detail please let me know Please advise if anyone has any tipsThanks in advance,Hi I hope you are fine you will need to have a default route configured in the ASA to point to your ISP also you will need have nat rules to translate the traffic and allow the connections to go through Could you kindly please send the configuration that you have built in the asa Best regards RVCE Ok I have setup up the static route to point to the comcast default gateway which is 6844xxxx Sorry I am not home at the moment and forgot the rest My local default gateway is 19216801 I have set static route to any to the above 6844xxxx default gateway address supplied by comcast but still a nogo Should the static route be the public IP from comcast or the public default gateway from comcast or neither I do not have any NAT rules at the moment but what would I setup for that Once I get home I will try to send the config over Thanks in advance RVCE Hi Austin I hope you are fine thanks for the configuration you will need to add a nat rule in order to allow the traffic reach the internet Please try to add the following If you are running ASA on code 924 nat insideoutside source dynamic any interface If you are running ASA on software version 82 nat inside 1 0 0 global outside 1 interface Let me know how it goes Hope this helps Best regards RVCE Unfortunately still no luck I feel that I am close Please see config below Im on 924 interface Ethernet00 switchport access vlan 2interface Ethernet01interface

in the last configuration the following default route route outside 0000 0000 68441421 1 Which is ok to configure a default route but my concern is that the outside interface is provided with a dhcp address the default gateway for the default route should be provided with dhcp as well I would like you to try the following From the ASA ping the 68441421 your ISP Gateway If the ping is sucessfull please run a packet tracer like the one below packettracer input inside tcp 192168010 1024 8888 80 And let me know the output If the ping does not work kindly please add the following configuration and test no route outside 0000 0000 68441421 1 The key in here is that you have already the setroute keyword this should let the asa to learn its default gateway and install the route by dhcp Since you have the following interface Vlan2nameif outsidesecuritylevel 0ip address dhcp setroute  setroute learns by dhcp the ip address of the gateway and installs the route on the table Hope this helps Best regards RVCE Unfortunately still no luck Please see below config Could DNS have any issue why the connection fails I currently have 00 set as DHCP and no static routes Also does it matter what the inside interface IP is Should this be my internal router IP I set it as 200 just so I could easily remember it but no device on my network is set at 200 Just mentioning some more details Let me

ASA Outside Interface Best Practise,HiFor an ASA Outside Interface which has no inbound services as such is there a need for an ACL on the InterfaceIt provides NAT only and access to the Outside world is locked down Inbound on the Inside Interface All return traffic would be allowed back due to the stateful nature of the ASAWhat is best practise for the Outside Interface With it having a lower security level I assume traffic coming into it from the Outside would not be able to pass to the Inside due to the Security Levels alone Solved Go to Solution,You are right with the given securitylevels no traffic that is initiated from outside will get into your network Some people still place an ACL with a line deny ip any any to the interface to see the hit count I wouldnt say its a best practice but its one valid way to handle it And remember that the ACLs on the ASA by default only filter transit traffic and not traffic that is sent to the ASA itself You dont need any ACEs for that  Dont stop after youve improved your network Improve the world by lending money to the working pooror share a meal with a hungry child RVCE You are right with the given securitylevels no traffic that is initiated from outside will get into your network Some people still place an ACL with a line deny ip any any to the interface to see the hit count I wouldnt say its a best practice but its one valid way to handle it And remember that the ACLs on the ASA by default only filter transit traffic and not traffic that is sent to the ASA itself You dont need any ACEs for that  Dont stop after youve improved your network Improve the world by lending money to the working pooror share a meal with a hungry child RVCE Thanks Karsten That confirms my thinking process
Management Interface ActiveStandby with different IP Scope,In a ASA ActiveStandby setup could I use differnet IP Scopes for the Management Interface or do the Management IPs have to be in same IP range,Management interface ip addresses must be on the same subnet Interface configuration is synced from the active to the standby unit Mark as helpful if this answers your question RVCE Thanks very much
Adding firewall to my existing LAN Network,DearsI am new to security need your help in designing my network with security ASA5506xmy current network has no security ISP modem connected to Router and I have multiple subnet for data voice and CCTV,You might wanna start by segmenting your network using your ASA firewall You may use ACLs between different security zones like internal to cctv network and route your untrusted networks like cctv dmz and wan connection to ISP on your new firewall to make sure those network segments are correctly restricted If you want to use security features like IPS Security Intelligence blacklisting IPs  Domains URL Filtering and Advanced Malware Protection for your internet traffic you can look into the Firepower module which can be used on your ASA for enhanced security features additional licenses required Let me know if you have any specific questions considering configuration or design RVCE Thank you kaisero for your response If you could assist me on configuring the ASA5506x to be added to my existing network for features currently i dont have license will go for it in future
ASA NAT ICMP Error Inspection and Traceroute,HiI have an ASA on the edge of my network When I traceroute from an outside host to an inside host the last few hops all appear as the NAT IP for the inside hostI have turned on ICMP inspection and ICMP error inspectionI was able to replicate the conditions in VIRL I have found that the cause of this issue is when I enable portoverloading We use port overloading for web access which covers anything that doesnt have a more specific NAT rule applied We use config something like thisThe thing that I cant understand is this Why does the router between the ASA and the inside host use the NAT IP of the inside host and not the IP from the portoverloadAlso is there a way to fix this behaviour I thought about a NAT exemption rule at the top of the list but I dont think I can create an exemption for just ICMP trafficAny ideasThanks,I have had a look at this document httpwwwciscocomcenustddocssecurityasaasa90configurationguideasa90cliconfiginspectbasichtmlpgfId1541261 From here I can see that normally without icmp error inspection the ASA will translate the error packet based on the destination IP of the packet that caused the error It gets this information from the ICMP payload Turning on icmp error inspection allows the ASA to rewrite this IP with the real IP of the device thats sending the error Thats why the traceroute looks right after enabling error inspection However config like this nat insideoutside afterauto source dynamic any Overload seems to override this behaviour and prevent the ASA from rewriting the ICMP error with the real IP Does anyone know why Here is part of the packet tracer result for an ICMP timeexceeded error coming from the inside Phase 3Type NATSubtype Result ALLOWConfignat insideoutside afterauto source dynamic any OverloadAdditional Information Phase 4Type NATSubtype persessionResult ALLOWConfigAdditional Information Phase 8Type NATSubtype rpfcheckResult ALLOWConfignat insideoutside afterauto source dynamic any OverloadAdditional Information RVCE This has been logged as bug CSCvc12093
ASA 5505 HELP  Ive now reverted to a previous version of the ASA software somehow,New to configuring Cisco routers Client bought one a refurbed ASA 5505 so I need to configure it Well it was running ASA software version 847 the Configuration register was 0x41So after configuring not knowing any better I unplugged took it to client site and realized my config did not survive reboot Fortunately I just found a text version of the config that I savedAt the advice of a member here I changed the Configuration register to 0x1 and now my enable passwordconfig survives rebootBut somehow now the device software version is 82 and its not understanding some of the commands I used when it was 84What can I do to get back 84 Is this possible The refurb guy that shipped it didnt send anything other than the device power and a sheet with the info on it but no software no console cable etc Solved Go to Solution,See if the newer image is on disk0 dir If so direct the ASA to boot from it boot system disk0image name Image name is something like asa847k8bin Save that config and reload RVCE See if the newer image is on disk0 dir If so direct the ASA to boot from it boot system disk0image name Image name is something like asa847k8bin Save that config and reload RVCE It almost worked dir Yields this I only included important lines Directory of disk0 158 rwx 15390720 033330 Aug 23 2013 asa825k8bin 163 rwx 24809472 232924 Sep 11 2013 asa847k8bin So I instructed it to boot from the second image which should be 847 and saved it however I get this at boot time WARNING BOOT variable added but unable to find disk0  Output from config line 45 boot system disk0 So dir tells me that disk 0 does in fact exist and it has the image I would like to boot to however at boot time it cant seem to see it Does this have something to do with the configuration register by any chance RVCE What exactly does you boot line now say If the configuration register value is 0x1 the ASA should follow the specified boot image from the startup configuration file Reference httpwwwciscocomcenustddocssecurityasaasacommandreferenceAHcmdref1c4htmlpgfId2167915 I would expect the following to be in place and work for you boot system disk0asa847k8bin RVCE Sorry been working on other clients the last couple of days Finally sat down and looked at the config it looks like there were two entries in the config when I added the second one I mustve accidentally added the first one as well boot system disk0 boot system disk0asa847k8bin That would explain why it wasnt loading the version I wanted and explains the error message as well I removed the first entry and boom now it works Thanks for all the help

ASA TCP Idle Connection Timeout Suspense,Hello I upgraded our Cisco ASA 5520 with a Cisco ASA 5585 Though both ASA were configured with default TCP Idle Connection Timeout values people are now starting to complaint that idle SSH connections are being terminated This is proper behavior but they were claiming it didnt occur with the old firewall Our users are setting keepalives for 1800 seconds to get around this before I can bump the setting to infinite setting 0 Is there a bug with the feature in older ASA OS,Hi Before looking for a bug I would check the ASA logs hopefully you are storing them to a separate Syslog server and see why the connections are torn down Teardown reason and how long have they been on the ASAs connection table before they were torn down You also have the option to perform traffic capture on the ASA for the traffic in question and confirm why or which party terminates the connection I guess you can use the MPF on the ASA to configure separate idle timeouts for just these SSH Connections if you do not want to touch the global timeout values I have not run into any problems with the timeout settings on the older softwares In the newer softwares 83 I have run into these problems In those situation the ASA has not removed the connection that have reached the timeout value I have seen connection that have been idle for over 1000h  Jouni RVCE Hello Jouni Forss recently weve got into the similar problem ASA 94 doesnt tear down connections with 1h default and 5m configured for most of connections idle timer Did u identify the reason why it happened Thank u

How to set number of login limitation to a linux server behind ASA Firewall,Please can anyone put me through on how to set number of login limitation to a linux server behind ASA Firewall Will it be done on the server or Firewall How can i achieve thatThanks,If you want to limit the amount of login attemps to your server your best bet would be using something like fail2bin on your server which will check your logfiles for failed logon attemps and blacklist IPs that exceed a certain threshold for a period of time In any case you could also limit the source ip addresses that can connect to your system via an ACL on ASA or on the server Let me know if this answers your question

ASA 5512x with Firepower Licensing question,I installed the SFR module on the ASA and ran through all the configuration I registered it to my FirePower Management Center however I failed to add the license to the SFR prior to doing that and the Management Center is not seeing my smart license for it so Im unsure as to how to add the license at this point Can I unregister the SFR from the management center to add the license through ASDM or is that not possible at this point is there another way to get the license addedthanks for any help,The FirePOWER services module on the ASA 5500x series still uses classic licensing You should use your Management Center and its licesing page  it has a license key that you use in the Cisco licensing portal to redeem your ASA FirePOWER license PAKs protectcontrol URL Filtering andor Advanced Malware Once redeemed you assigned them to the managed ASA FirePOWER module RVCE The problem is that within the management center on the licensing page it is showing 0 for the number of licenses for any of the modules purchased and when I click edit I get an message about no smart license devices being managed So how do I add the licenses that I purchased for the devices into the management center I synchronized the management center with the smart license server and that didnt do it RVCE These are all classic licenses Dont use smart licenses for this purpose Smart licenses are for FTD and ASA when running on a FirePOWER 4100 or 9300 series You should have a PAK for the licenses you purchased You combine the license key in FMC with those PAKs in Cisco license portal You then paste the resultant licenses into FMC and apply them to the managed devices
ASA 5516x Management routing,I have a question regarding setting up a management interface on an ASA 5516x firewall If I dedicate an interface to a management network and then create a static route rule on this management interface then will the destination address go back out this interface if it comes in the management interface So basically I will have an IT subnet that can access the management network but will also be part of the inside network so I am not sure if the traffic destined to the IT subnet from the outside would go out the managment network instead of the inside interface since it will have a lower cost during normal browsing Or do you dedicate a machine to the management network,Historically an ASA only had a single routing table That made use of the management interface for remote connections eg off the connected management subnet problematic Since ASA software 951 there is the option of using a separate management only routing table The release notes cover this httpwwwciscocomcenustddocssecurityasaasa95releasenotesasarn95html Traffic THROUGH the ASA eg from the outside will not transit the management interface RVCE Thanks for the link So I assume this means that if I mark an interface as management only then the asa will use the management only routing table for lookups Does the firepower management interface need to be in the inside networks subnet now
ASA L2L VPN with Remote DHCP,I have a funny setup I am trying to finalize and struggling a bitI need to setup a 5505 behind an ISP provided router The 5505 then needs to make a L2L tunnel back to the corporate 5525 Once that tunnel is established I need to have a phone on the remote side plugged directly into the ASA pull a DHCP address from the corporate DHCP pool and connect to the phone server on the corporate networkI have tried this a couple of ways but have had no success getting the tunnel to come up When I connect the ASA to the ISP router the outside interface for the ASA should be an address on the client side of the ISP router correct ie 1921680x Then the corporate side should use the static public IP of the ISP router to create the L2L tunnel if I am thinking of this properlyOnce I have that I setup DHCPrelay on the remote ASA to grab an address from the proper DHCP poolserver and I should be good but I am struggling getting the tunnel up first and then from there I guess I have to test the other piecesAm I going about this wrong Should the tunnel be from outside to outside or is there another way to do this This is a bit outside my knowledge of security so I am here looking for some ideasThank you in advance,Hi Please check this link I think this matches your query httpssupportforumsciscocomblog149511 Regards Aditya Please rate helpful posts and mark correct answers RVCE I have read through this a couple of times What I am confused about is do you setup the L2L tunnel to go Inside to Inside or Outside to Outside I have never done an inside to inside tunnel so I am a little in the dark about that

ASA 5505 configuration lost after reboot,So I went through the process of configuring this 5505 and the next day took it to the client site and booted it up First thing I noticed was BAM enable config password was back to blank Ok I thought set it again and did a write mem and then had to unplug it to move it to a new areaBooted up and now ENTIRE configuration is goneback to the factory config it was a refurb so whatever the refurb guys put on it Its running ASA software version 84 if thats helpful so I have two questions I guess Solved Go to Solution,hi could you post a show version output i suspect an issue with the config register you should fix it using the command configregister 0x1 RVCE hi could you post a show version output i suspect an issue with the config register you should fix it using the command configregister 0x1 RVCE Thanks From the show version I have this Configuration register is 0x41 I went ahead and changed it per your advice and the enable password survived a reboot yay Now is there anyway to rescue my former config Im assuming it is lost but figured Id check and save myself the time spent reconfiguring from scratch RVCE hi thanks for the rating and im glad it solved the confreg issue unfortunately when you set confreg to 0x41 it bypassed the startup config saved on NVRAM youll have to reapply your config hope you got a backup copy RVCE Unfortunately I dont and the device was handed to me on 0x41 the refurb guys apparently set it to that wish I had known because the config took me hours of grief my others are all 5506s and some of the config stuff is different in this 8x version of the software which gave me massive headaches as Im not a CiscoIOS guy  well I guess Im becoming one now out of necessity lol Oh well lesson learned and I wont be buying anything ever from the company that this was purchased from client purchased without consulting me so it was too late RVCE hi you could use a show startupconfig and see if your config is still there RVCE Tried that when I first noticed it missing unfortunately its gone But a good lesson here too once I finish this time Ill save it to USB and put it somewhere safe just in case as this is a client so I wont be in their office on a regular basis and you never know what could happen

Help with Cisco ASA 5510 configuration cli,I am new to Cisco I have asa 5510 router that I am trying to setup I have no static IP from my ISP I have a cable modem and Cisco 2950 switch with 5 computersWhat I am planning to do is to connect the cable modem to the Ethernet 00 to receive a dynamic IP from ISP What I have done so far is this nameif int e00 Outside ip address dhcp setrouteI have configured dhcp server on the Inside interface e01 ie 19216801 2552552550 and this interface connect to the switch I can ping the 19216801 from the PC that is connected to the switch and other PC are also getting correct IP address via the switchI have 2 problem I cannot connect to the Internet and the second problem is that I cannot connect to asa router to manage it I did enable http server on the Inside interface but I cannot get to the management interface using http19216801 from the computers that is connected to the switchAny help will be appreciated If you can provide me with a sample configuration that would be a great help No need to refer me to other links if you have a solution please post it hereThank you,Hi Are you able to ping the inside interface If yesconfigure ssh on it You would need to generate the RSA key  Everything else is same as enabling http access That http you enabled is for ASDM access You can download ASDM from ciscocom Steps to configure ASDM asdm image dosk0asdm645bin if image name is asdm645bin then http server enable http 10000 255000 inside if your machine is in 10000 subnet behind inside interface Go to the machine open a browser and type in https it will open the GUI Regarding no internet access What do you see in logs Have you configured NAT What version of ASA are you running Regards Kanwal Note Please mark answers if they are helpful RVCE Thank you Kanwal for your reply Yes I can ping the inside interface with no problem No I have not configure the NAT yet Idont know how to configure the NAT and default route Thank you so much for your help I appreciate your time I RVCE Hi You would need to NAT the traffic to our ISP assigned IP on outside interface to access internet What is the version you are running I can tell you the rule format then since the syntax differs in different versions Regards Kanwal Note Please mark answers if they are helpful RVCE Thank you Kanwal I am away from the system right now will post the version later What will be the generic cli syntax for the NAT note I have no ISP static IP I use dhcp for the Outside interfaceto obtain IP from the ISP cable modem Thanks again for your time RVCE Hi You will have to first define object and then do nat insideoutside source dynamic interface since interface is the keyword whatever IP interface has the inside ips will be natted to it I know you have suggested against pasting links but i guess you wouldnt mind this one This is how nat looked in pre and post 83 So you can take a look and decide which one is useful for you

the configuration in the link but I am not sure which ip address belongs to the inside or outside and which ip address to use for the object in my case I guess I have to replace the outside ip address

in my own case since I do not have a static ip I will need to replace with interface id e00 Also assuming my system is 83 would the obj10116 represent Inside interface or outside interface object network obj10116 host 10116 nat insideoutside static 192168100100 should the host be individual IP or the whole network My internal network is 19216800 based on the ip in this example I am not sure which IP is the inside or outside interface Thank you RVCE yes 10116 would be the inside But you need dynamic so that all your ips can nat to same interface IP So under object you would need to select range or subnet Regards Kanwal Note Please mark answers if they are helpful RVCE Would this work object network obj19216800host 19216800nat insideoutside dynamic e00 My inside interface ip address is

New 5525ASA in my network rack but can not login to web interface,This is a terribly simple question I have a new CISCO 5525ASA unit in a network rack It was previously configured by someone else and I plugged in an ethernet CAT6 cable to port 00 on the back of it with the other end going to a very old switch I can ping it just fine The ip address on this port is a valid real world internet address that looks like 20623521132  not the real ip address of course  Other devices on that same old switch can ping the address fine I have a serial console cable attached and can access the console fine What I can not seem to do is login to the device in any way I am told there is a web interface but I suspect the issue is simply routing I do not see the command the inspect the default route anywhere in the CLI manual and I have tried to enter the command route outside 0000 0000 20623521131 but that always just returns ERROR  Invalid input detected at  marker which is not very helpfulCurious if there is some trivial way to set a default route for traffic on that interface At the very least SSH access would be expectedThis stuff may be helpful Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance Software Version 9224 Device Manager Version 7221Compiled on Tue 29Jul14 2341 PDT by buildersSystem image file is disk0asa9224smpk8binConfig file at boot was startupconfigciscoasa up 1 day 17 hoursHardware ASA5525 8192 MB RAM CPU Lynnfield 2394 MHz 1 CPU 4 cores ASA 4096 MB RAM 1 CPU 1 coreInternal ATA Compact Flash 8192MBBIOS Flash MXxxxxxxxx  0xffbb0000 8192KBEncryption hardware device  Cisco ASA55xx onboard accelerator revision 0x1 Boot microcode  CNPxMCBOOT200 SSLIKE microcode  CNPxMCSSLPLUST020 IPSec microcode  CNPxMCIPSECMAIN0026 Number of accelerators 1Baseboard Management Controller revision 0x1 Firmware Version 24I changed the BIOS FLash info above but it may not be specific to this devicealsointerface GigabitEthernet00 nameif outside securitylevel 0 ip address 20623521132 255255255224 interface GigabitEthernet01 nameif inside securitylevel 100 ip address 19216811 2552552550 interface Management00 managementonly nameif management securitylevel 100 ip address 19216821 2552552550 http server enablehttp 19216820 2552552550 managementhttp 19216810 2552552550 insidehttp 0000 0000 outsideIn any case I can ping it but only with another system on the exact same old switch Nothing from the outside world and there seems to be no way to ssh into it nor access a webhttps interface or anything else Most likely because of the http rules above  but at the very least there must be a way to allow https access to a specific ip in the real world Does this make sense,Hi There is no WEB access You have telnet ssh and ASDM Please look at below discussions on how to enable ASDM and SSH access httpssupportforumsciscocomdiscussion11290531howconfigureasdmciscoasa5505 httpssupportforumsciscocomdiscussion11581111howenablesshasa5525 Hope this helps Let me know if you have any questions Regards Kanwal Note Please mark answers if they are helpful

Firepower Intrusion detection How to disablewhitelist rule for spesific hosts,HiI have implemented Firepower Intrusion detection on my ASA 5525X and how a question One of the rules blocks traffic between 2 hosts but I do not want this traffic to be blocked between these hosts I want the rule to be active but how can I prevent the rule to block traffic between these 2 hosts while blocking traffic for other hosts that are hit by the ruleBrThorEgil Solved Go to Solution,Hello this can be achived by implementing Access control rule for those two hosts Lets assume you need to disable IPS Policy for traffic between 19216815 and 1721615 Inseret the new access rule above the rule with IPS policy configured Choose the trust action for new rule See the attach Alternatively if you dont want to disable IPS between two hosts completely you can create a new IPS policy with the signature which blocks traffic between two hosts currently setted to disabled state After that create the new access rule as in the first example but with action Allow and implement a new IPS policy with disabled signature RVCE Hello this can be achived by implementing Access control rule for those two hosts Lets assume you need to disable IPS Policy for traffic between 19216815 and 1721615 Inseret the new access rule above the rule with IPS policy configured Choose the trust action for new rule See the attach Alternatively if you dont want to disable IPS between two hosts completely you can create a new IPS policy with the signature which blocks traffic between two hosts currently setted to disabled state After that create the new access rule as in the first example but with action Allow and implement a new IPS policy with disabled signature RVCE Thanks your first solution will work for me Br ThorEgil RVCE Thanks so much This was the solution I needed for fix a SiteSite HyperV replication problem

Flow closed by inspection,AllI am having an intermittent issue with an SQL based application running on a point to point style network At each end an ASA firewall protects the 2 application servers When the application fails a generic SQL error appears in relation to TCP timeouts At this exact time the firewall produces this errorAny ideas please how I can progressD Solved Go to Solution,Ok good to read Interesting is this part here Classmap ipsclassmap IPS card status Up mode promiscuous failopen packet input 32 packet output 75530394851 drop 32 resetdrop 0 That looks like you also have the IPS card installed In this case it might be a policy there if you send the affected traffic to the IPS I dont have any IPS experience though cant help if the traffic goes through it Also some recommendation you have some very old inspects active which I recommend to disable for better compatibility These are dns 512 is not enough for ibmcom for example esmtp this breaks encrypted mail transfer in some cases netbios unless you need netbios traversing the firewall RVCE This sounds like you have an inspect configured for this type of traffic Check your inspection rules in ASDM thats under configuration  Firewall  Service Policy Rules RVCE Thanks Is there a way I can determine which inspection rule is doing this D RVCE As far as I can tell not in an easy way if there is a lot of traffic on this firewall On a positive note it must be I hope one of the inspections and not a default one It must be a customized one as there is no default one for Port 1433 Im not sure if that will be dropped and logged in the ASP function if so this should help On the CLI you can see all aspdrop statistics with show asp drop See here for more info httpwwwciscocomcenustddocssecurityasaasa82commandreferencecmdrefs2html With clear asp drop counters you can clear the counters RVCE Thanks for your response this is helpful I cant see anything obvious from an inspection point of view however we are running 846 code on this ASA pair and I have seen a bug on 84 with flow closed by inspection CSCUJ54806 Perhaps now is the time to upgrade our code D RVCE I believe thats the wrong bug id for me it shows a security vulnerability with ICMP But yeah if there is such a bug in the 846 code then I recommend you to switch to a fixed release In case you go to a 9x code read carefully the release notes of all previous versions special attention to 90 there were some configuration changes involved The biggest change are unified accessrules RVCE This issue has futher developed and when the SQL application fails I see the following log on the ASA 6 Nov 09 2016 102008 106015 1111 1433 2222 61520 Deny TCP no connection from 11111433 to 222261520

VRF with Cisco Firepower,I am proposing a security solution for one of my customers with one of the options below · Firepower 4120 Bundle · FPR9300 SM24 Bundle · FPR9300 SM36 Bundle He had a few concerns· They are looking to use Firewalls to be the security node to gate access between VRFs· There will be web filtering product and bandwidth management unit in between· Each business units have their own firewalls with their own web filtering solution and aggregate in the Core· They desire a single check point for security between VRFs My concerns is the ability for an ASA to handle bandwidth since Firewalls are no routers especially in this case since VRFs are involved where firewalls may be a bottleneck Is there any information regarding routing specs or do the tech specs on CCO apply to stateful inspection apply to routed traffic The traffic actually is routed through the firewall and is supposed to meet those specs I am thinking of proposing a highend Catalyst switch to handle VRF routing Any thoughts Thanks,Stateful inspection throughput matches up to the cisco published throughput imo Multiprotocol stateful inspection throughput should be considered for sizing in case only l4 features are used and the workload consists of the typical enterprise mix of traffic To make a general assumption of how much the device will be able to handle also consider looking into 3rd party test results NSS Labs publishes a yearly NGFW report that includes Cisco ASA Apart from security viability they also check the vendors throughput claims and verify them Reading through your requirements I would question if they even need central firewalling You mentioned that every customer already uses their own firewall solution and you are only connecting between them  is that correct or is there some central service involved that is exposed to the customers and should be protected centrally RVCE Thanks Kaisero To answer your question The client is a parent company and provide the core services The other divisions have their own firewalls just to protect their internal LAN but they do access Internet via parent Core Network RVCE Is there anything else you would like to know Since your question was very open I am not sure you got all the info you are looking for
Cisco Firewall Overlapping Internal Network Issue,I am trying to protect an internal network from another internal network on the same subnet with a cisco 5505 firewall I dont know if it is possible with the conifguration my boss would like to implement but I have attached a jpeg photo of the layout,Do I need a router to get traffic on the same subnet to anoter network on the same subnet through the firewall RVCE Hi Yeah you need another device in between its not possible to configure 2 firewall interfaces on the same subnet unless you have multicontext mode which is not supported on the 5505 Even if you get that router in between youll have to do full network source address translation on the ASA and the router in order to protect the overlapping network I know you mentioned the addressing cant be changed but it seems the best route you can take is to break that class C subnet into two 25 nets HTH Pablo RVCE Yep I am going to change the subnet on one network and assign others to the servers
traffic flow on ASA,DearsPlease find the attached topology Interface name on the ASA areInside WebfilterIN WebfilterOUT Link balancer Outside WANSFR job will be only IPS inspection and malware inspectionI have internal user for whom I m planning to pass the Internet traffic through the web filter I will do the PBR on the ASA inside interface to route internet traffic to web filter and then the web filter will check url filtering and send the traffic from the web filter out interface to the ASA  then on the ASA again I m doing the another PBR for the Web filter out interface the traffic which I receive I will push it on to the link balancerI have below 2 question for the above designThanks,Dears Nobody has the answer for my query above or the question is not clear thanks RVCE Hi Clark Sending the same traffic twice will be unnecessary Going by the norm you should place the webfilter inline unless it does not have that capability so that the traffic is sent and inspected once through ASA and IPS Ideally we would want that whatever traffic is denied at the webfilter level should not even go through ASA once So any blocked traffic should be blocked as close to source as possible by placing the webfilter internal to the ASA Now there can be a workaround with your existing design For that we need to know if the webfilter lets the traffic pass as it is or NAT using its own ip address So for IPS inspection we can send the traffic using the source ip address and creating a policympf We can exempt either the real machines or the webfilter Other than that I would prefer having the webfilter inline HTH AJ RVCE Dear linking As it was planned before for placing the webfilter internal to ASA as close to the source but later it was changed to place it as mentioned above so I want to know is it the traffic will be send twice  to the SFR Now there can be a workaround with your existing design For that we need to know if the webfilter lets the traffic pass as it is or NAT using its own ip address there is no NAT it will passed as it is we can send the traffic using the source ip address and creating a policympf We can exempt either the real machines or the webfilter I have permit ip any any in the SFR accesslist so that every traffic is sent to the SFR Now the traffic is not natted from the webfilter so how I can restrict traffic internal host not to route twice to the sfr Regards RVCE Since the traffic after getting filtered would be coming from web filterOUT interace it would be then better to have interface specific policy rather than global policy Ideally we have a global policy and we apply SFR policy there But in your case you can have a interface specific policy so that traffic coming from lan to webfilter is not inspected So that would take care of the issue of traffic getting inspected twice I have few more concerns 1 since the lan subnet is behind lan interface if the traffic comes to ASA from web filterOUT interface it might get dropped 2 even if we manage to send the outbound traffic the return traffic might again get dropped due to same reasons Please test and see what challenges you face Regards AJ RVCE Dear the 2 concerns u have raised r really killing me from day1 Just want to know the packet which will go out from the Asa webfilter in interface when it will receive from webfilter out interface will not be maintained by AsaAsa will treat as a differ t packet Becz here we r not changing the IP add of the source Pls get me answer for ur concerns Becz Im going to do the change RVCE Hi Clark Packet get initiated by lan user  goes from webfilterin interface to webfilter This part is fine Once the webfilter sends the packet through out interface back to ASA that is when the ASA might think of this as spoof since the source is actually located behind lan interface Also even if this traffic comes to ASA the return traffic will not be handled correctly since it might go to lan not come back the same way ASA is not supposed to like that either My suggestion  make a topology wherein the webfilter is inline so that the design becomes as below lan user  webfilter  inside ASA outside0 internet handoff This will make things simpler in a longer run If you still wish to use current setup find a way to NAT the lan users when they are filtered through webfilter so that ASA does not take that as spoof and return traffic follows the same path HTH AJ RVCE Dear Linking Sorry for the delay as I was out of the country If I NAT on the webfilter than there will be no issue but in this case I want to avoid to send traffic twice to the SFR module thanks
ASA Transparent  BVI,Dear allWe are facing some issue when we try to upgrade our firewall5505 from 82 to 84We have a router configured with two networksone as secondary when we upgraded the version the firewall stop to allow traffic diferent from its manageable network exampleRouter internal network is 19216800 and the 19216810 is secondaryFirewall is configured with BVI on 19216800 networkTraffic from 19216810 is being blocked on firewall even with accessrule allowing itOn Cisco documentation its saying that traffic outside of BVI interface will be droppedMy question is which version did started to happen and if this occurs only on 5505 model Many thanks,

Switching traffic between interfaces,Hi EveryoneI am facing an issue for a IP The packet tracer on the asdm says the packet will be routed correctly and without any error from the ingress interface to the egress interfaceNow when I capture the ingress interface I can see the packets in wireshark But I cant see those packets in the egress captureNB this particular ip is not reachable from the FirewallSo my Question is Is this a normal behavior that the ASA will not switch the packets from the ingress to egress if the destination host is not reachable or it will be switched regardless of the reachability of the destination Or is this something on the ASA itself I doubt this because the rules pretty straight forward and another IP from the same subnet is working fine and again the packet tracer tells me everything is fine for this particular IPThank you everyone in advance,Your firewall the same is true for every IPdevice needs to know to which address on layer2 the packet should be forwarded For that an ARP packet is sent out If there is no one answering then the actual packet is discarded This is normal behavior  Dont stop after youve improved your network Improve the world by lending money to the working pooror share a meal with a hungry child RVCE U mean the arp of the next hop for the egress interface right The next hop is reachable by the way RVCE So you have a remote destination in your case that is not reachable I assumed your host is on the same outside network of the ASA Only the next hop which can be a router needs to be reachable in that case If you dont see the egresspackets in that case then I assume that your capturestatement is not matching that traffic  Dont stop after youve improved your network Improve the world by lending money to the working pooror share a meal with a hungry child
ASASM in transparent mode Confused about Vlans etc,Hi AllWe are planning to have our traffic through a 6500 switch pass through an ASASM firewall The IP addressing etc is controlled by the customer and cannot be changed to include extra networks so we have decided to use transparent modeI am pretty familiar with ASASM being used in routed mode on 6500 switches and understand how the VlansLayer 3 hops work I cannot figure it out for the ASASM in transparent modeHeres the current setupHeres what I am trying to achieve Do I pass either Vlan 100 or Vlan 200 to the firewall or both,
Clarity on features,Hi TeamWe have been asked to respond to the queries as mentioned hereWe can either go for ASA with firepower services or FTD but need clarity on above for both of themKindly advise,It you are internal Cisco please consult the CECbased resources that are available There are many that can answer those questions and more see for example the TDM Technical Decision Maker presentations

casesNote This inspection is enabled by default The following command is added to the default global service policy inspect ipoptions Therefore the ASA allows RSVP traffic that contains packets with the Router Alert option option 20 when the ASA is in routed modeThe following commands were introduced policymap type inspect ipoptions inspect ipoptions eool nop Regards Kanwal Note Please mark

NAT on a stick disabling ssh,Ive got a standard single interface router hosting a number of ipsec tunnels Im attempting to add a loopback interface and enable nat outside on the physical interface The second I enable ip nat outside I lose ssh and telnet access from both inside and outside This being a azure csr router I have no console access to it and have to reboot it each time to get it backIs there some reason nat outside is blocking access I intend on using route maps to nat some specific tunnel traffic but simply enabling nat kicks me off entirelyinterface Loopback1 ip address 11111 255255255255 ip nat insideinterface FastEthernet00 ip address 1723134 2552552550 ip nat outside duplex auto speed auto crypto map clientvpnip nat inside source list NAT interface FastEthernet00 overloadip accesslist extended NAT permit ip 1723100 00255255 any,what IP address are you connecting to when sshing into the machine 1723134 Please remember to rate useful posts by clicking on the stars below RVCE Yes from the local network I can still ping the interface after enabling nat outside on it but ports 2223 instantly close RVCE You may have to enable SSH on an additional nondefault port In my experience ASA firmwares dont handle direct access to addressesports with NAT mappings in the way you might expect If you keep the NAT mapping and the local access separate they will probably both work simultaneously Otherwise not  Jim Leinweber WI State Lab of Hygiene RVCE Ok I think I figured out what I was missing I expected because i was on the local network I would still have access to those ports but becaues Ive enabled nat outside on it it blocks incoming traffic I can actually access sshtelnet on the loopback ip if Im routed to the F00 interface All I needed was to open the port with a static map ip nat inside source static tcp 11111 23 int f00 23 That opened telnet back up silly oversight on my part

Can we publish a web server to internet from another subnet,I know few about network knowledgeThere are three countries Europe is 101xx Singapore is 102xx Korea is 103xx All of them can access each otherNow we have published one European web server 10111 in Europe can we publish the web server 10111 on Singapore and Korea firewall againThanksAdsnow,Hi As long as each country can reach the 101xx subnet you should be able to publish the server on each firewall HTH Pablo RVCE Thanks Pablo
Firepower FTD  Transfer Packets,HiI am hoping somebody can elaborate on the Transfer Packet featureoption when adding a device to the FMCThe Cisco document says this option is on by default and that it the FTD device sends packet data with the events to the Firepower Management Center So does this mean that if the FTD device has 1 Gig of data traffic transiting the device then the device also sends a full copy of the packet payloads to the FMC ie the FMC effectively receives 1 Gig ish of dataThe Cisco documentation does not really explain what this feature is really doing and a post from Todd Lammle httpswwwlammlecomblog4685installingciscofirepowerimportantquestionsanswerstart seem to indicate that it is sending the full payloadI am thinking of locating the FMC in a central DC and managing multiple FTD devices at other remote sitesDCs over the Internet and I am struggling to figure out what the inbound bandwidth hit is going to be at the FMC end especially if each FTD device is sending a full copy of the payload of every packetHas anybody got any experience of using the Transfer packet featureoption that they could share with me pleaseRgdsJohn,The Transfer Packet is used to sent packets to the FMC in case a certain event is triggered eg snort detected pattern xy in packet  send event  packet to fmc This option will not cause the sensor to send all traffic to FMC Connection events will not include the actually payload but only metadata about the connection Let me know if this answers your question RVCE Hi Kaisero Thank you for the quick reply Your answer makes total sense and is a lot clearer than the Cisco documentation I take it that transfer packet option is not just used for IPSSnort events but is also used for malware and file control events as well John RVCE MalwareFile events only contain metadata and not the blockeddetected payload In case a cloud lookup yields no resultdisposition  unknownunavailable the sensor directly uploads the file to AMP ThreatGRID for dynamic analysis in case your File Policy is correctly configured You can see the results of the files analyzed in ThreatGRID at Analysis  Files  Captured Files FMC polls information from ThreatGRID and updates the information shown in the Captured Files View kinds regards Oliver RVCE Thanks kaisero

ASA 5525X Subinterface Support,Hello EveryoneOur organisation maintains customer networks remotely and all the clients are segregated based on VRF ex VRFa is customer 1  VRFb is customer 2 stc This VRF is configured on the Routers through which we get connected to clients network either over MPLS P2P link etcOur internal servers are currently exiting through a Transparent Mode firewall to reach the Routers which is now planned to replace with a ASA No plan to implement ASA in transparent mode The design requires 1 subinterface for each client and now I am stumbling upon the fact that ASA 5525X supports only upto 200 VLANSSubinterfacesUnfortunately the overall design needs 2 Subinterfaces for each client theoretically i can probably support upto 100 clients only Now the question which i have is is there a way to increase the number of VLANS supported on this firewall If yes howAppreciate your responses,Im not aware of a way to increase the limit But the limit is based on the model the bigger ASAs have a higher limit but also with the 5555X its only 500 VLANs If you dont need the higher inspectionthroughput then a router with firewall featureset is probably the more flexible solution  Dont stop after youve improved your network Improve the world by lending money to the working pooror share a meal with a hungry child
Pix 506E hangs on reboot after displaying PCI Device table,I have a 506E that hangs after displaying the PCI device table After some research I found that this can be resolved by switching the internal jumper and having done this the device now boots successfully and loads the configI was hoping someone might be able to advise what this jumper is so that I have a better understanding of why this problem occurred Secondly I came across a post which suggested that this is just a temporary fix and that once it happens the device should be replaced Again if anyone has experience and could comment on this I would appreciate some feedback,The jumper on the PIX Firewall 16 MB Flash circuit board must not be removed or repositioned The PIX Firewall system will not work if this jumper is moved Refer to the following url for more infohttpwwwciscocomenUSdocssecuritypixpix53hwinstallationguideboardhtmlwp1019930 RVCE Apologies for reviving an old thread I had the same problem with my Pix506e In the first photo you can see the green jumper J5 just to the right of the fan It is in the normal operating position I moved it across to the left to jump the centre and left pins started the unit and let it boot Then I turned it off and set the jumper back to the original position and restarted It then operated as normal Id suggest that being close to the CMOS battery it would reset the BIOS These Pix are basically an Intel 440BX based computer Ive upgraded the processor to a Pentium III 900MHz CPU The original CPU is a SL36A Celeron 300A You can get around 512MB of RAM in there but you have to use the lower profile SIMMs due to case height restrictions The RAM is just standard PC133 stuff Matt RVCE dear rhysclementevansI have 515E that hangs similarly after displaying the PCI device tableCISCO SYSTEMS PIX FIREWALL Embedded BIOS Version 43207 010202 16122273 Compiled by morlee 64 MB RAM PCI Device Table Bus Dev Func VendID DevID Class Irq 00 00 00 8086 7192 Host Bridge 00 07 00 8086 7110 ISA Bridge 00 07 01 8086 7111 IDE Controller 00 07 02 8086 7112 Serial Bus 9 00 07 03 8086 7113 PCI Bridge 00 0D 00 8086 1209 Ethernet 11 00 0E 00 8086 1209 Ethernet 10 00 11 00 1011 0026 PCItoPCI Br 00 13 00 14E4 5823 CoProcessor 5 01 04 00 8086 1229 Ethernet 11 01 05 00 8086 1229 Ethernet 10 01 06 00 8086 1229 Ethernet 9 01 07 00 8086 1229 Ethernet 5 Could you please guide me the details of jumper setting u used to solve the problem so that i can try to fix my machine too Thanks RVCE Hello JohnAccording to Smahbub this can break your pix If you have any other recourse then I would investigate those options first Having said that I did some webmining regarding the 506E and found that some posters reported that they had resolved this issue by opening their case moving the jumper inside only one located in the centre of the board to the other position three pins jumper on right hand two switched it to left hand two and the system then bootedI performed that operation and got past the problem I switched the jumper back to the original position and the Pix has been working reliably sinceI do have to highlight Smahbubs comments though copied below and another poster elsewhere reported that once it manifests this problem the device should be considered unreliable as the issue will reoccur I havent seen that comment repeated elsewhere and my own experience shows otherwise  so farBest of luck in resolving your issueRhysSmahbub wrote The jumper on the PIX Firewall 16 MB Flash circuit board must not be removed or repositioned The PIX Firewall system will not work if this jumper is moved RVCE Thanx rhysclementevans it worked for my 515E too

network Improve the world by lending money to the working pooror share a meal with a hungry child RVCE hi iwen  i am confuse with this scenario  as if you go through my diagram  i am not find any supporting document in which i found this kind of scenario  thats why i need to post  RVCE You have to look at each firewall individually and configure all needed parts routing accesscontrol and so on NAT should typically be done only on one device the one that has public IPs outside and private inside But I dont think that youll find a ready to use scenario for that  Dont stop after youve improved your network Improve the world by lending money to the working pooror share a meal with a hungry child RVCE hi iwen  i am posting my configuration for both  issue i am facing i cannot ping or reach FW2 to FW1  CORE and from firewall FW1 TO INTERNETROUTER  FW2  Even i attach the snap for FW1 AND FW2 interface status  and ping results FW1 connected toFW2 AND INTERNET ROUTER ASA Version 916hostname

Upgrading Firepower  Version 540763,Hello everybodyI have a customer working with the Firepower on version 540763 no SSL Inspection feature yet Its working fine and I dont have problems with it Now I want to know what is better do the upgrade to most recently version from 54x or upgrade to version 6xI have other customers with version 610330 and they are having many problems I think that is better to stay in 54 What do you recommend The last version from 54 is stable If I have some problem can I do the rollbackSince now I appreciate the attention Solved Go to Solution,Unless you need specific features in the 6x train I would recommend staying with the latest version of 54 There are many new features that are being added in the 6x train especially when you go with the FTD code However as with everything new there are issuesbugs  I hope this helps Thank you for rating helpful posts RVCE Unless you need specific features in the 6x train I would recommend staying with the latest version of 54 There are many new features that are being added in the 6x train especially when you go with the FTD code However as with everything new there are issuesbugs  I hope this helps Thank you for rating helpful posts RVCE Hello Neno Thanks for your answer I will keep in version 54 until to have better results with 6
ASA to Router Config,Hello allI have a question and I am hoping you can answer it for meI have a situation where I am going to have a isr 1941 connected to an ASA 5508The public IP for the outside interface of the router and the ASA need to be on the same 29 This will mean my connection will have to pass through my inside interface of the Router I know it can be done I just cant find the right article to show me examplesAlso I need a good article that can show me how to pass traffic from the ASA to the Router if my router will be at the border and the ASA is behind it,Hi Gregory Could you please explain your query in little more detail For now I understand that the routers outside interface will be connected to the ASA which makes ASA the border device however you are saying the opposite If possible just make a rough topology and confirm your exact query To be honest it does not look to be a big task as all we need to do is to apply interface level configuration on ASA and apply some access rules to allow the traffic  Pulkit RVCE Yes it is the opposite The current environment does not have a router It is just the firewall We will be putting a Router at the Border to do DMVPN We currently have a meshed topology through Site to site VPNs on the ASA While doing this transition we need to keep that ASA VPN connection up from all the remote sites which means I have to have a public IP on both the outside interface of the Routers as well as the ASA I do not have 2 seperate blocks of public IPs just a single 29 I need to place the 2 outside interfaces on the same subnet and pass the traffic through the inside interface of the router InternetRouterFirewall RVCE If you have an open ip from your ISP provider and your current meshed topology is internet facingapply an open public ip address to the router and place it in parallel to the ASA Then you can drop a tunnel on the ASA and bring it up through the router Another alternative is to attach the outside interface of the router to the ASA and apply a static nat using an open public ip address to leverage the protection the firewall brings

Does ASA support MLAG,HelloDoes ASA support MLAG I am checking recently connection between ASA to switch via Etherchannel and find a terms of MLAG Could you please adviseThanks,Yes ASA supports MLAG on the switch side You may use stackwise  vss  vpc to connect ASA to your network Since ASA is not aware of the MLAG technology there will be no issues In case ASA clustering activeactive is used keep in mind that only certain switch hardware is supported for MLAG
Mutiple destination for single url,Hi AllOne of our client requested to allow one url hosted in internet Destination ips are too many but at a time only one will be in working statethey keep changing the destination ips in a short time interval Is there any solution is available for this kind of cases We cant use proxy for this due to performance issue Those ips can not be routed in our network too due to security policySource  Multiple internal subnetsDestination around 100 subnetsports  80443,Hi Sumit Assuming that you are asking this query in regards to how we can allow this traffic through the ASA Correct me if I am wrong but from the current understanding it looks as if we want to allow inside users behind the ASA to have access to a particular url for which it has many IP addresses Please let me know if already your traffic from inside to outside is not allowed for all since most of the urls have multiple IP addresses If your requirement is to allow traffic to a specific URL then you can use domain based access list Please read the below link and let me know if you have any query  httpssupportforumsciscocomdocument66011usinghostnamesdnsaccesslistsconfigurationstepscaveatsandtroubleshooting  Pulkit

ASA reset packet,Hello AllIf i am trying to access FW separated server and im getting reset packet on FW who generates itAs in destination server generates the reset packet or FW itself generates it,Either can generate it it depends on the configuration You can do a packet capture on either the server or the ASA to determine which device is actually dropping it httpwwwciscocomcenussupportdocssecurityasa5500xseriesnextgenerationfirewalls118097configureasa00html RVCE Both are capable of sending reset packets are depending on circumstances each can send one The best way to find out who is sending reset is to take capture on either the destination server nic through wireshark or take capture on ingress and egress interface of the firewall If you take capture on the firewall and see the reset only on egress and not on ingress interface then we are sure that firewall generated the same Ideally if firewall generates the reset packet it sends one to both ends HTHAJ

ASA 95214 suddenly stops forwarding traffic between all connected interfaces,Had this problem today with ASA 5516X on ASA v95214 Essentially the firewall stopped forwarding all between connected interfacessubnets From the firewall console I could ping pretty much anything in the network and on the internet But from any given server or workstation outside that subnet nothing was reachableI had ASDM filtering set to debugging and I literally saw nothing to indicate any firewall rules were being violated except for the ones we wanted We also have SourceFire running 601 Since the sourcefire management server was unreachable it couldnt log what was going on However I didnt see anything on the ASA debug log that indicated SFR was dropping any traffic  no SFR requested entries To spot check SFR further I disabled the Service Policy rules to no effect The failover action is permit traffic in case SFR crashesClearing xlate didnt help I checked routes to the internet tried manually failing over the internet interfaces and still nothing could either talk to the internet or to another interfaceThe only thing that worked was powering off both firewalls simultaneously and turning them both back on Since then Ive downgraded to 95210 since I ran for months on that with no issues Has anyone had a similar problem,I had the same issue with ASA 5516 Version 96110

Cisco ASA route to another gateway,HiI have a Cisco ASA which is the gateway for all devicesThe ASA has two LAN interfaces 19216810124 and 19216820124There is also another router on the network that has its own WAN connection its on 19216820254shares second subnet with ASAI need to add a route to ensure all devices on the 19216810x subnet goes out the 19216820254 gateways WAN connection for a list of specific public ip Is this just a route I am having issues with it workingThanks Solved Go to Solution,Hi Iano In case all traffic to the specified destination should be routed to your router at 19216820254 you would only have to add a route on ASA Keep in mind that the router needs a route to your 19216810024 network in case you dont use a HideNAT between 19216810024 and 19216820024 so return traffic is routed to the ASA again Let me know if this answers your question RVCE Hi Iano In case all traffic to the specified destination should be routed to your router at 19216820254 you would only have to add a route on ASA Keep in mind that the router needs a route to your 19216810024 network in case you dont use a HideNAT between 19216810024 and 19216820024 so return traffic is routed to the ASA again Let me know if this answers your question

ASA FW Conversion question,Hi AllI know there are a couple of things that changes when you upgrade from 82 to anything above 82My questionIs it really necessary to convert the nat 0 stuffMy thoughts are that post 82 nothing is NATed by default NAT is not necessary so if the routing is correct and there is an appropriate ACL traffic will flow If I understand correctly nat0 was used to circumvent natcontrol in the old days because a NAT entry was necessary for the connection to be allowedSo what am I missing hereCan I ignore the nat0 stuffPlease adviseCiaoJC Solved Go to Solution,Hi JC When you upgrade from 82 to anything higher NAT and ACL changes are important Whatever you mentioned about NAT 0 or nat exempt is pretty much correct because of the NAT control feature on old code However NAT 0 is also used for vpn traffic and that will be there on new codes as well Cisco always recommends to perform the upgrade on the box itself to the new version as it automatically converts the configuration for you and also provide the upgrade errors which one can look in and correct if required Let me know if you have any further query  Pulkit RVCE The big changes are NAT at 83 and v4v6 ACL unification at 90 If you have existing 82 nat stuff the nat0 things probably should be translated to phase I twice NAT style and any actual mappings to phase II object network NAT style If you have existing separate v6 access lists as of 90 the keywords are any4 for v4 any any6 for v6 any and any for dualstack v4v6 in your new unified lists I endorse all of Mr Saxenas advice  Jim Leinweber WI State Lab of Hygiene RVCE Hi JC When you upgrade from 82 to anything higher NAT and ACL changes are important Whatever you mentioned about NAT 0 or nat exempt is pretty much correct because of the NAT control feature on old code However NAT 0 is also used for vpn traffic and that will be there on new codes as well Cisco always recommends to perform the upgrade on the box itself to the new version as it automatically converts the configuration for you and also provide the upgrade errors which one can look in and correct if required Let me know if you have any further query  Pulkit RVCE Hi Guys Thanks for the quick replies I agree with your responses Some points for comment please I see when you do the wizard upgrade from 82 to 83 the wizard As well as FW conversion tool on fwmciscocom  creates a lot of any objects any any01 any02 etc and onject nats which actually screws up the operation of some connections In our lab I have removed those and their nat statements and the connections seems to be OK I agree with the VPN stuff and you need to create nats for any remote access vpn stuff Ciao JC RVCE Hi JC I do agree that a few extra statements are created but not necessarily the one which are not required If you have manually taken care of that nothing better than that Yes as per your requirement you will NAT for VPN and RAVPN  Pulkit RVCE The big changes are NAT at 83 and v4v6 ACL unification at 90 If you have existing 82 nat stuff the nat0 things probably should be translated to phase I twice NAT style and any actual mappings to phase II object network NAT style If you have existing separate v6 access lists as of 90 the keywords are any4 for v4 any any6 for v6 any and any for dualstack v4v6 in your new unified lists I endorse all of Mr Saxenas advice  Jim Leinweber WI State Lab of Hygiene

how to upgrade 2 failover FWSM,hi i have 2 6509 core switches with each one having one fwsm installed and failover configured between them i plan to do the following upgradeasdm613F  623Fios405  4115i read that if it isnt a major upgarde i can upgrade them with the failover configured but the issue is the method  so far i read i do a copy tftp flashimage i read i should name the upgrade ios as image  correct then i restart the module should i restart it from the fwsm cli or from the core switch like restart module  but how do i upgrade the asdm i did a show flash on the fwsm but the result was confusinglash file system version3 magic0x12345679 file 0 origin 0 length6390272 file 1 origin 6390272 length11554384 file 2 origin17945088 length3385 file 3 origin17948672 length31516 file 4 origin21085696 length280please help,Copy the new system software its not called ios by the way to both the primary and standby unit as explained here httpwwwciscocomcenustddocssecurityfwsmfwsm41configurationguidefwsmcfgswcnfgfhtmlwp1042136 Then follow this procedure httpwwwciscocomcenustddocssecurityfwsmfwsm41configurationguidefwsmcfgswcnfgfhtmlwp1064044 You will be reloading the SecondaryStandby unit from the primary units FWSM cli The failover and repeat from the now SecondaryActive unit Finally you will then failover once more and have the end result of both units upgraded and the operational status of PrimaryActive and SecondaryStandby To upgrade ASDM simply copy the new ASDM image to both units as described here httpwwwciscocomcenustddocssecurityfwsmfwsm41configurationguidefwsmcfgswcnfgfhtmlwp1052263 When you reload ASDM from your client the new image will be used RVCE thank you  so to get this clear  1first i copy the application software to both fwsm using this  copy tftp flash 2i save configuration on both fwsm 3after copying the file it will replace the already application software installed and reloading it will boot into the new one without chaning boot variable like in switches 3i reload the standby then wait for it to come up then switch to it and make it active then reload the former active fwsm for the asdm 1first i copy the asdm to both fwsm using this  copy tftp flashasdm this time i sepcify flashasdm 2i save configuration on both fwsm 3after copying the file it will replace the already asdm installed and reloading it will boot into the new one without chaning boot variable like in switches 3i reload the standby then wait for it to come up then switch to it and make it active then reload the former active fwsm RVCE Thats correct except for the very last step  you do not need to reload the FWSM to have the new ASDM in effect  only restart ASDM on your client machine You do copy it over using the source asdm file name and target  flashasdm RVCE ok so for the asdm it will be like that  copy tftptype in source nfile name flashasdm i name the file simply asdm on the fwsm also for the application software what do i name the file on the flash do i name it image or the source file name like copy tftptype in source file name flashimage  do i need to change boot file like in switches RVCE The target file names should be cdisk for the system software asdm for the ASDM image as noted in the guides linked above The FWSM is distinct from the standard ASAs in that way You do not have to specify a boot image or ASDM image with a separate command RVCE i found my ASDM have an upgrade option in the GUI  it seems much simpler and easier than CLI  but my question is  1do i upgrade the software and asdm on the standby fwsm then reload then make it primary 2then upgrade the previous primary now secondary fwsm
Failover configuration order for adding secondary,It has been a few years since I added a second ASA to an active one that was not configured for failover I forget the order to activate failover I remember the first time doing this I goofed and the secondary unit which had nothing but failover configured kept overwriting the primary unitSo I have a 5510 with failover configured and it is enabled Do I add in the second ASA by first enabling the managementfailover interface verifying that it can ping the primary keep all the other interfaces disabled and then commit the failover command I already have the base failover configured and there are certs on the primary that need to be pushed to the secondary Once the primary finishes pushing the configuration to the standby then enable the interfaces Since the active unit is already enabled I shouldnt see any downtime for this or will I,Heres the cut sheet I use On PRIMARYfailover lan unit primaryfailover lan interface FAILOVERINTF GigabitEthernet06failover link STATEFULFAILOVERINTF GigabitEthernet07failover interface ip FAILOVERINTF 1692542541 255255255252 standby 1692542542failover interface ip STATEFULFAILOVERINTF 1692542545 255255255252 standby 1692542546failover ipsec preshared 0 SeCrEtKeYOn SECONDARYfailover lan unit secondaryfailover lan interface FAILOVERINTF GigabitEthernet06failover link STATEFULFAILOVERINTF GigabitEthernet07failover interface ip FAILOVERINTF 1692542541 255255255252 standby 1692542542failover interface ip STATEFULFAILOVERINTF 1692542545 255255255252 standby 1692542546failover ipsec preshared 0 SeCrEtKeYPROCEDURESOn PRIMARYfailoverOn Secondaryfailover On PRIMARY  monitor interface nameif
Setting up Vendor ASA off my network InsideOutside interface ip addressing,AllA Vendor ASA will connect to my Core device via portchannel They will need to access a few devices on my network which will be restricted with acls by address and portI have given Vendor a subnet 19216853x from my network to use for their devices that will hang off Inside interface of this ASA My question is Can I Split the 19216853x subnet to use for both Inside and Outside interfacesI do not want to have to burn more than 1 subnet range for this limited networkOutside would be 1921685325332Inside would be 19216853125What adverse issues wouldcould be caused by this,That should work just fine As long as the subnets dont overlap it will work HTH

ASA v9x DCERPC Inspection not working correctly with HyperV Manager,Hi AllIm having issues with this particular traffic flow and see multiple connections from various source ports to the same high order port TCP49155 being denied whilst using hyperv manager through the firewall Bidirectional AD traffic works fine using DCERPC inspection just not Hyperv Manager I can see the Hyperv manager is using DCOM ISystemActivator with RemoteCreateInstance calls for port TCP49155 but for some reason its refusing to work unless I manually open ports 4915465535 bidirectionally Is this a bug I have tried 92 94 95 96 with no luck Do anyone have a working solution for Hyperv Manager through the ASA I have experimented with pinhole timers but this does not fix the issue eitherAny advice appreciatedcheersMatt,
