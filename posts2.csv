SG20018 turns off on its own,Hello Cisco Im encountering a weird issue with SG20018 switchesFor no reason the switch goes totally down No more connexion on the uplink all ports stop blinking cannot access the conf interfaceThe System LED is still on but the all switch is deadOnly workaround is rebooting the switch manually Have you heard of this  Any fix  Thanks in advance Solved Go to Solution,HiIt could be an IOS problem I suggest upgrade it and verify again Otherway contact you vendor to request the warranty RVCE HiIt could be an IOS problem I suggest upgrade it and verify again Otherway contact you vendor to request the warranty RVCE I thougt I was up to date with 1476 will update to 1480 and let you know if the problem is fixed RVCE Thank you please keep me posted RVCE We did the update so far no switch turned down but it could take several days of uninterrupted service for the problem to appear RVCE Hi Thank you for the update I will be here for any assistance if the problem appears again
Ring Topology  Private dark fiber,Hi guysI have a question and need your wise recommendation regarding the scenario Requirement One of our customers has decided to have their own private dark fiber connection  ring topology We as partners have to recommend and design their network for this topology They are also looking to replace their Core Switches and terminate this fiber on the sameTricky part In the ring topology the connection is 1 2  3  4 Now the tricky thing is 1 is their MAIN site and 3 is their DR Site Since MAIN and DR are supposed to be directly connected this wont be a case in this This is how they are connecting the dark fiber  say cost constraint and distance Suggestions I am not sure if there is any Technology where I can have 13 direct connection to avoid latency Please suggest if there is any technology which can be used in this case Appreciate your support ThanksWarm Regards Solved Go to Solution,Hello With DWDM you can dedicate wavelengths that pass through the intermediate site to allow for a direct connection between the main and DR site and even have redundancy going both ways around the ring So physically it would be a ring but logically you could define the desired topology This would also eliminate having to route traffic through the intermediate site which is probably best Hope this helps RVCE Not all Cisco equipment supports REP For smaller Cisco devices they often need to be MetroE devicesREP like STP can be used to break a L2 loop but if you will be routing you can create a pair of logical p2p links between main and DR so no need to use REP RVCE Hello With DWDM you can dedicate wavelengths that pass through the intermediate site to allow for a direct connection between the main and DR site and even have redundancy going both ways around the ring So physically it would be a ring but logically you could define the desired topology This would also eliminate having to route traffic through the intermediate site which is probably best Hope this helps RVCE You could as Chris suggested build an optical network to carry a DWDM lambda between your main site and DR site but that will add to your expenseIf your 1 2 3 and 4 site devices are all L3 switches you could just pass a VLAN through a transit switch making the mainDR connection look like a p2p Ie you shouldnt need another L2 switch Also using VLANs you could use DWDM or CWDM or regular opticsIf your 1 2 3 and 4 site devices support MPLS you could do the same with a MPLS tunnel between mainDR Again your choice of DWDM or CWDM or regular optics RVCE Thank you both Chris and Joseph for your valuable input and suggestion regarding this Suggestion3 Resilient Ethernet Protocol  REP for the Ring topology can this be used The consultant working with customer suggested this technology I never came across this before RVCE Never heard of REP before but after reading about it I wouldnt entirely be sure it would be a good fit in your scenario It seems it would be more applicable to a LAN environment I also dont think youd want your ring to be a big layer 2 domain Just my personal thoughts Some may have other ideas Regards RVCE Not all Cisco equipment supports REP For smaller Cisco devices they often need to be MetroE devicesREP like STP can be used to break a L2 loop but if you will be routing you can create a pair of logical p2p links between main and DR so no need to use REP
KVM and LXC hyper visors on cisco isr4331,cisco told everyone that you can runn your own apps on our new ISR4000 routers so now i dont know how can i make a lxc virtual machine and run an app on my router does anyone know how to achieve that how can i make a virtual machine on my router or how can i run a Linux app on ios xe routers,i actually want to run a ddns service on my router witch ios xe does not support or i dont know how to configure it so i want to use a linux software to achieve that
Traffic Load balancing with two ISP,HI I have two ISP link terminated on single routerBut in present scenario we are using only ONE Linkso it is look like  ISP1 Router Firewall Network Switch here we use dynamic natting on firewallAll IPs used here are public IPsNow the requirement is We want it to load balance internal traffic to two links so how we can achieve thisWe have multiple IP ranges in internal network and used VLAN and all these IPs natted PAT on firewall and then traffic goes to router internal interface configured public IP from Firewall interfaceconfigured public IPNow if we have Second ISP now only configured router WAN interfaceWhat are the steps to achieve the load balancing Thanks in Advance,How do you route to the Internet on your router If using a static default route it could be as simple as adding a second default route statement This assumes your public IPs are yours and not the 1st ISPsIf your router supports Ciscos PfR your router could dynamically load balance your egress traffic to to your two ISPs RVCE Hi Thanks for replyingWe are using default route Also we have 28 block of Public IPsAlso please note we are using firewall HP A F1000 and router HP A MSR 5040But we want to do it using dynamic routing  how we can achieve this RVCE Just to confirm your public IPs are yours not from your ISP correct I didnt think IANA allocated less than 24sIf youre using a default route then as mentioned on my first post it may be as simple as adding a second default route although I cannot confirm the workings of your HP routerFor dynamic routing you would normally take Internet routes all routes or partial routes from both your ISPs usually using BGP Of course taking two full copies of all Internet routes demands a router capable of handling that Again I cannot comment on your HP routerFurther I think it debatable how much benefit youll obtain taking full Internet routes from both ISPs Partial Internet routes might be more effective but for either BGP is going to just provide number of AS hops with closest being better but without accounting for actual path bandwidths
Add systemshutdown on a Catalyst Using SNMP,HiWe have multiple SW on a network who we cannot access because of memory error We would like to reboot the sw to access it It is far from us so we would like to do it by SNMP We have not the SNMP systemshutdown command on the config but is it possible to send it to the device using SNMP Solved Go to Solution,In normal prime could try get prime to send config to it with command… do reload at x as it will only be in config mode  but im not sure if the Do statement works in Prime config push mode  haven’t tried it before RVCE If the switches are having a mem alloc failure and cant be accessed  snmp may not get through at all  is there no one that could reboot them locally RVCE Thanks for the response Mark Am afraid it want be easy because the SW is in a difficult position that why it would be so good if there is a way to do it remote We have cisco prime access on the device do you know if it is possible to reboot with prime RVCE In normal prime could try get prime to send config to it with command… do reload at x as it will only be in config mode  but im not sure if the Do statement works in Prime config push mode  haven’t tried it before
BGP NeighborsLoopbacks or Directly Connected,When would you want to make your BGP neighbor their loopback as opposed to your neighbors connected interface Solved Go to Solution,It depends if you are forming an IBGP neighborship or EBGP neighborship With IBGP it is preferable to peer over loopback interface This is so because loopback is an always UP interface unless its manually shutdown and if a physical link goes up there might be an alternate path via IGP to reach the loopback Thus the BGP session will not go down vs if it is over a physical interface With EBGP session usually the peerings are with provider and over a public IP Thus the neighborship is established over physical interface But for security reasons the peering can be established over loopback with two conditions in mind  loopback to loopbackphysical interface reachability is there between the two peering devices  proper ebgpmultihop is configure or if the peering is between two directly connected router over loopback then disableconnectedcheck command can be configured for the neighbor Hope this answers your question Regards Vinit ThanksVinit RVCE It depends if you are forming an IBGP neighborship or EBGP neighborship With IBGP it is preferable to peer over loopback interface This is so because loopback is an always UP interface unless its manually shutdown and if a physical link goes up there might be an alternate path via IGP to reach the loopback Thus the BGP session will not go down vs if it is over a physical interface With EBGP session usually the peerings are with provider and over a public IP Thus the neighborship is established over physical interface But for security reasons the peering can be established over loopback with two conditions in mind  loopback to loopbackphysical interface reachability is there between the two peering devices  proper ebgpmultihop is configure or if the peering is between two directly connected router over loopback then disableconnectedcheck command can be configured for the neighbor Hope this answers your question Regards Vinit ThanksVinit RVCE Hi Vinit I have similar kind of situation while using disableconnectedcheck command Is it possible to form neighborship between two routers R1 and R2  where R1 is having neighbor command with IP address of physical interface of R2 and R2 have neighbor command with address of Loopback Interface of R1 On R1 router bgp 100 neighbor 192168122 remoteas 200  192168122 is the Physical interface IP of R2 On R2 router bgp 200 neighbor 1111 remoteas 100 neighbor 1111 updatesource Loopback0  1111 is the loopback of R1 Will it work in any ways or does disableconnectedcheck will help RVCE Hi Vinit Thanks for the quick reply I agree with you Sir but in my case I want to establish EBGP neighborship and the requirement is like on one router its is loopback int addr and on other end router it is physical int addr onto which I am forming neighborshipIf it is possible then also I do not have to use EbgpMultihop Thanks Ritesh RVCE Loopback use case  iBGP neighbors with multiple direct L2 connections This is an ideal for peering between loopbacks since they can use either ethernet interface  Multiple T1s between you and ISP would be an ebgp multihop scenario between loopbacks Connected interface  eBGP to your service providers  iBGP only one interface between routers Things like that best regards tim RVCE Disclaimer The Author of this posting offers the information contained within this posting without consideration and with the readers understanding that theres no implied or expressed suitability or fitness for any purpose Information provided is for informational purposes only and should not be construed as rendering professional advice of any kind Usage of this postings information is solely at readers own risk Liability Disclaimer In no event shall Author be liable for any damages wha2tsoever including without limitation damages for loss of use data or profit arising out of the use or inability to use the postings information even if Author has been advised of the possibility of such damage Posting The other posters have well answered how loopbacks or directly connected interfaces are typically used However I did want to mention when using iBGP and loopbacks you may want to also use nexthopself to have the loopback passed to its iBGP peers as BGPs next hop address too
iWAN on L2 VPN,We currently use L2 VPN for branch connectivity Is it possible to deploy iWAN on L2 VPN environment,Hi IWAN is an overlay using DMVPN  the underlay is not relevant at all so doesnt matter what you have currently in theory This technology supports use of multiple WAN transports as the transport type is associated to the underlay network and is not relevant to the overlay network which is consistent to the DMVPN tunnel

Cisco Router  How to testconfirm after configuring to acl to permit only port 80 traffic inbound,I have configured ACL in the router to permit only port 80 traffic inbound to the web serverHow do i testconfirm the HTTP connectivity between the router and the web server,Hi there If you want to test the ACL from inside you network you could use a PC on another VLAN routed by the router and run an NMAP scan against the server This should hopefully show that only port 80 is open If you want to test your ACL from an external location you could use the following website httpswwwyougetsignalcomtoolsopenports cheers Seb RVCE Thanks for the reply Still i am not clearNMAP wont work in my router Do i have install itMy problemInternal host should be able to access web server via port 80 and 8080 only other access is restrictedThis configuration is done on the router that is connected to the web serverI am able to ping the router and the web server from internal hosts hosts connected to the same router But how do i confirm verify my solution1 the router is permitting only port 80 and port 8080 traffic from internal hosts2 the connectivity is working as well between the router and the web server using port 80 and 8080 something like ping with port i know it doesnt workThanks RVCE The NMAP suggestion was to install it on a PC in another subnet and run a scan against the server from there If you cant do that you could add the log statement to the implicit deny at the end of your ACL  ip accesslist ext 808080TOSERVER permit tcp any host xxxx eq 80 permit tcp any host xxxx eq 8080 deny tcp any any log  logging buffer info  This will confirm that all traffic other that TCP80 and TCP8080 is being dropped cheers Seb RVCE Hi If you enable the logs on the ACL it can display registers also you can execute show accesslist accesslist name and you will see the matches Check this link httpswwwciscocomcenusaboutsecuritycenteraccesscontrollistlogginghtml Hope it is useful

Cisco Grok Patterns,Working on a new syslog solution and have the need to parse cisco syslogs from routers catalyst switches nexus switches etc Has anyone spent some time developing grok patterns specific to this Ive found some good references for ASA but not much for traditional IOS and NXOS devices Thanks,
creating SSH to LAN devices From Router,hellomy PC is having IP on the network like the Router  13266xxmy router is having two networkfirst  WAN using IP 13266xx second  LAN is having also VLAN1 configured on 1010xxto this LAN network connected 40 devices that getting IP from the one of the Server who is also on the LAN network but not from the RouterI can get from my PC 13266xx SSH via Putty to the Router Wan address 13266xx i login to the router now i am in the global moderouter i want to make a SSH from the command line of the router to those 40 devices every time i pick one of them but i cannot i dont know why maybe it is not configured to allow SSH to those devices you can see the conf heresee the attached filewhat can i do to make the SSH to those 40 devices workthanks Solved Go to Solution,Hi there Are you say that the following command would not work ssh l intelwifi 101010x replacing x with the host ID of you of your servers If so try removing the following line  no ip ssh sourceinterface GigabitEthernet0  cheers Seb RVCE Hi there Are you say that the following command would not work ssh l intelwifi 101010x replacing x with the host ID of you of your servers If so try removing the following line  no ip ssh sourceinterface GigabitEthernet0  cheers Seb RVCE Firstly you need to verify that ssh is supported and allowed on end devices Are you able to ping them from the router you also may need to configure the router for outbound ssh connections transput output ssh if it is set to transput output none under line vty 0 4 RVCE that would be to the WAN network SSH but it is also ok but not what i asked

AccessList Deny Range of Ip subnet,Hi I have a router with a few computers connected to itThese computers are subneted with a 26 255255255192 There is a computer for each subnet 2 66 130 194I am trying do deny access to the outgoing port F10 for ips ranging from 1010963  10109127I tried to deny access by making aaccesslist 1 permit 101090 000255accesslist 2 deny 1010964 00063int f10ip accessgroup 2 outseems like everything is prohibitedI am really confused how to do this with out using nat Once I try nat things seem to get even more confusingIgnoring nat and dhcp for the moment how would I get this to work with Ip addresses that are staticBtw I am using GNS 3 and my router is cisco 7200 and I am using a standard access listI basically want to have 3 subnets 0 128 192 to be allowed to leave the network and eventually also have nat translate their ip to a range of 19216811  1921681254 Had this working with out trying to deny a subnetAll I seem to be able to do is deny everything and I feel like it has something to do with deny being appended to the permit access list at the endAny ideas would be great for this noobie Solved Go to Solution,Eric Okay this is happening because you NAT the packets then check against the outbound acl So when the packets are checked against accesslist 2 they no longer have source IPs of 1010xx they have been changed to 1921681x addresses So the most traditional way of doing this is to remove your acl from fa01 and apply this accesslist to the e21 interface Note i am assuming that the 101016426 network is allowed to talk to the rest of the 10101x subnets but not allowed out past the fa01 interface  If this is not the case let me know  accesslist 101 permit ip 1010164 00063 101010 000255 accesslist 101 deny ip 1010164 00063 any int e21 ip accessgroup 101 in and then you need to remove the access list from fa01 ie int fa01 no ip accessgroup 2 out You can leave the NAT as it is What the above will do is allow 101016426 to talk to any other 10101x subnet but to nothing elseJon RVCE Ericaccesslist 1 permit 101090 000255accesslist 2 deny 1010964 00063you have an accesslist 2 which only has denies in it applied to the interface Note that in the above you have 2 accesslists ie not the same one Try this  accesslist 1 deny 1010964 00063 accesslist 1 permit ip 101090 000255 int fa01ip accessgroup 2 out

is not allowing 1010164  10101127 to enter the interface to be translated Im slightly confused as to what youy are trying to do I thought you didnt want 1010164  127 to be allowed out and if it isnt allowed out then it wont be natted Perhaps you could explain a bit more bout exactly what you are trying to do Jon RVCE Hey Jon thanks for the replyI am trying to deny 1010164  127 but allow everything else to be natedMy problem seems to be that everything is getting denied meaning 101010  10101255Id like only to deny 1010164  127 while everything else enters the interface and gets nated RVCE Eric Can you try your pings from clients rather than a router interface ie try a ping from a device in the 101016426 network which shouldnt work and then try from a device in any of the other 10101x networks which should work Your config looks fine Jon RVCE Hey Jon thanks for the replyI have been pinging only from the clientsIt works great when nat is not set up Everything makes it to the next router through my static routesalso I have a static route from 19216810 24 so everything exiting should go backonce I addaccesslist 1 permit 101010 000255Routerconfigip nat pool 1 19216812

itnerface and then a permit of any any they all go through meaning that the adress has been translated to nat then it is becking checked against the interface accesslist everything is getting denied because the list says to deny 64  127 and to allow only 101010  10101255 since 19216810  255 is not specified it is denied when it is specified it is allowed but if only one packet is being sent any computer from any network will consume the first available ip in that range since I am only using a24 for my pool of addresses RVCE Eric Okay this is happening because you NAT the packets then check against the outbound acl So when the packets are checked against accesslist 2 they no longer have source IPs of 1010xx they have been changed to 1921681x addresses So the most traditional way of doing

nothing elseJon RVCE Thanks it works well now When I tried to deny on the interface of the 64 network I did it wrong I was trying to deny its destination thinking I can target the interface 101021 but it wasnt destined there it was just passing throughNow I understand that I need to allow the incoming packets in that network to go to a destination range of my choice then just deny everything else It wont make it to the interface to be nat Thanks A lot I really appreciate the helpBtw I am a network begginer if you know some tutorials that would be awesomeAnyways thanks a lot RVCE Eric Glad you got it working My apologies because i should have spotted that earlier when i said your config was fine A very useful doc when dealing with IOS with NATacls etc is this one which tells you the order the router does things in  httpwwwciscocomenUStechtk648tk361technologiestechnote09186a0080133dddshtmlyou can see from this that NAT happens before any outbound accesslists are checked and this explains what was happening with your config As for tutorials it really depends on what you are trying to do Cisco has a huge amount of docs many of which are configuration docs to achieve specific things Also if you are a network beginner you may want to consider purchasing a CCNA book even if you dont intend to actually take the CCNA examAnd of course there is always this site where there are many people who are only too happy to help with configuration problems and also explaining any concepts that you may be struggling with Feel free to post any queries you have in the future Jon RVCE I

DMVPN Dual Hub  Dual Cloud  Phase 3  OSPF SpoketoSpoke not working,Please help verifying my configuration everything is working fine except for SpoketoSpoke When Hub1 is down the traffic is going through Hub2 and vice versa but wen both Hub1 and Hub2 are down Spoke1 cant see Spoke2 Attached the config Solved Go to Solution,This answered my question If you are using dynamic routing protocol inside the tunnels you will loose your routes once the Hub failed so there is nothing you can do spoke2spoke communication is lost If you are using static routing and If the spoke already has a NHRP entry before the hub failed it will use it But if the remote spoke public address changed in the meantime it will not work as there is no HUB to answer to the NHRP resolution request RVCE Hello Can you share the topology again I can´t see on the previous post If I helped you somehow please rate it as useful RVCE config is in the attached txt files RVCE It sounds like when Hub1 and Hub2 go down then spoke1 and spoke2 cannot communicate because the tunnel between both spokes use the tunnel configured on both hubs RVCE but wen both Hub1 and Hub2 are down Spoke1 cant see Spoke2 The spoke to spoke tunnels are dynamic the spokes rely on the Hubs in order to inform them of the IP address of the other spoke in order to build a dynamic spoketospoke tunnel Prior to a dynamic spoketospoke tunnel being built the first packet would always go to the hub before being routed to the other spoke the tunnel is built and all susequent packets go direct to the spoke This is why the Hub is so important So when both hubs are down yes it would be expected that the spokes cannot form a tunnel The Hubs should be made highly available perhaps build additional Hubs RVCE You are correct when I do show dmvpn on both spokes each has a static tunnel to Hub1 and Hub2 When I do traceroute on Spoke 1 to Spoke 2 it goes through Hub1 when I repeat the traceroute it goes directly to Spoke 2 After the traceroute I checked the dmvpn on both Spokes and they both had a new dynamic tunnel to each other Once I shutdown the uplink on Hub1 and Hub2 the static and the dynamic tunnels disappear and Spokes cant see each other anymore RVCE This answered my question If you are using dynamic routing protocol inside the tunnels you will loose your routes once the Hub failed so there is nothing you can do spoke2spoke communication is lost If you are using static routing and If the spoke already has a NHRP entry before the hub failed it will use it But if the remote spoke public address changed in the meantime it will not work as there is no HUB to answer to the NHRP resolution request
routemap application concern,Hi experts I have a question related to the following output routemap Firstthere is a first sequence 5 to match the private addressing space meaning any internal resources to follow my regular traffic if it matches it will skip and continue normally since there is no set clause Second there is a second sequence 10 to allow any other traffic no internal resources to go lets say Internet that if matches the CLIENTIPPUBLIC accesslist will be forced to the next hop 1921681020 My question is what traffic is the last sequence 100 you can see the packets there is a lot of traffic going to this hole Is it the same CLIENTIPPRIVATE traffic that is falling here Is it needed this sequence at the end Ultimately there is an implicit deny so why would I have and want to have a last sequence if my interesting traffic is matched at the beggining but the rest Internet wanted to go to the sequence 10 Is it true that I have a lot of sequences with no set clause causes high CPU You see my point For example I have a local PC it wants to talk to an internal server in another subnet so the source is 192168110 and destination is 17217100100 via http so first it falls in the first sequence 5 since there is no set it will go and follow its regular ip routing table destination Lets say the same PC wants to go to a public resource in the Internet then it falls into the sequence 10 correct Just keep in eye in the group CLIENTIPPRIVATE and CLIENTIPPUBLIC acls since they contain the same source set of subnets Please check the accesslist below as well to avoid confusion So then what is the rest of the traffic 200732200 marked in the last sequence 100 that falls into sequence 100 would be the same to let the implicit does its job Is this a good aproach or any better

for specific IP address probably the sequence 100 is used for the rest of the traffic It could had been made to manipulate the traffic for one specific IP and the rest will use the normal path You should check what IP addresses are included on this addrgroup CLIENTS RVCE Hi Moisa THanks for your assistance indeed dont know how but somehow the object is the same used or at least I got confused with it but after reviewing the running I discovered the object inside and it has two addresses I was wrong so the logic is fine objectgroup ip address CLIENTS hostinfo 1069132225 hostinfo 1069132251 thanks for your help RVCE Hi Alex Not sure what is happening with your route map but to answer your specific question no you dont need the last statement in your route map because with PBR any traffic that does not match any of the permit statements is simply routed using the routing table It may be there because when you use a route map with route redistribution you often see an empty permit statement because any routes not matched specifically are filtered without an empty permit statement Jon RVCE I see thanks Jon so there are many forms I can take actions then depending on the requierement but after reading a bit more its what you are saying thanks for your help and taking the time
Network command in bgp,Helloi want to know in case if route advertised to router PE by ibgp does it must have exact match in routing table of PE to adv through ebgp to another PE or just this needed at CE when using network command at it BR Solved Go to Solution, we dont need network command and exact match for network in RT in R2 in order to adv it to R3  Yes you do not need network command to advertise the iBGP learned routes from R2 to eBGP neighbor R3 However you need to remember two things 1 About Synchronization  You need to disable synchronization using no synchronization command otherwise BGP does not advertise iBGP learned routes to eBGP neighbors unless it validates the route through IGP 2 Best path selection algorithm  Since only best paths are announced to BGP peers make sure the iBGP learned route on R2 is selected as a bestpath to reach to the destination network HTH Meheretab RVCE Hello JackNo you do not need to have exact match of the route in the routing table of the PE since the route is already advertised to it through iBGP You will need it in the routing table of the CE if it the route is advertised to BGP using the network command on the CEHTHMeheretab RVCE so in case network connected to R1 and network command used and R1 connected to R2 and network prefix adv using ibgp to R2 when R2 adv network to R3 which connect with R2 by ebgp  we dont need network command and exact match for network in RT in R2 in order to adv it to R3  thanks for reply RVCE Hi Usually if you are advertising any route using network command the information must be match with the information into the routing table for example You are receiving the network 1000024 but you set up network 10000 mask 255000 it will not be advertised to other router because the mask is not matching The same case if you are advertising a route using Prefixlist you must match the subnet mask like you have received it But if you are filtering the networks to be advertised you dont need network command between eBGP routers But if you are going to use any filtering method like prefix list you must match the subnet mask otherwise it will not be advertised to the neighbor RVCE  we dont need network command and exact match for network in RT in R2 in order to adv it to R3  Yes you do not need network command to advertise the iBGP learned routes from R2 to eBGP neighbor R3 However you need to remember two things 1 About Synchronization  You need to disable synchronization using no synchronization command otherwise BGP does not advertise iBGP learned routes to eBGP neighbors unless it validates the route through IGP 2 Best path selection algorithm  Since only best paths are announced to BGP peers make sure the iBGP learned route on R2 is selected as a bestpath to reach to the destination network HTH Meheretab RVCE so in case network connected to R1 and R1 connected with R2 with ibgp does this network command must have exact match in routing table or not in R2 in order to adv it through ebgp to R3 BR RVCE Hi For example R1  iBGPR2eBGPR3 R1 must advertise a prefix with the network command and it must included the same network and subnet mask like known through the routing table R2 does not required use network command it will advertise the R1s prefix to R3 But if you are going to use prefixlist on R2 in order to advertise specific prefix to R3 you must add to the prefix list the same network with its subnet mask like it has been known into the routing table Imagine R2 received from R1 the prefix 1000132 and 1010132 and you want to advertise them to R3 you cannot use ip prefixlist TEST seq 5 permit 1000024 To advertise both they will not be advertised to R3 so you need to use no ip prefixlist TEST seq 5 permit 1000024 ip prefixlist TEST seq 5 permit 1000132 ip prefixlist TEST seq 10 permit 1010132 Hope it is useful  RVCE so R2 dont need exact match for prefix in its routing table to adv it to R3 RVCE You do not always need to have exact match in routing table of R2 most of the time you will have though The reason is that you might have best path learned in BGP table which is not installed in the RIB routing table bc of ribfailure r  there could be a static route configured which has higher administrative distance and will be installed in the routing table The ribfailure route is still advertised to peers unless you run bgp suppressinactiveHTHMeheretab
DHCP Relay in MPLS,We have an MPLS connecting our sitesPlans are to implement VLANs to separate LAN traffic accordingly in each siteOur current setup is Main site has a server tasked with DHCP functions The remote sites have the cisco routers doing the DHCP allocationSo lets say in the main site the DHCP server is in VLAN 2 Is it possible to configure the routers in the remote sites with DHCP Relay where this requests can be sent to the main sitePS Our service provider cannot give me the router settings and claims that it is not possible with our current MPLS setup but I beg to differ with him So my question is more of Is it possible,From experience I can tell you that some providers indeed do not allowsupport DHCP across their MPLS network Dont ask why cos I never got an answer back when asking why DHCP relay is a unicast so I cant see the complexity but also I cant look inside the MPLS network either Please remember to rate useful posts by clicking on the stars below
Direct specific LAN subnet to use specific NAT pool to reach internet,Hello all I am working on a design to get some granular control over NATPAT but it seems to be a challengeOur ISP has provided us a small block of routable IPs Our IOS edge router has multiple VLANs behind it We presently have all traffic egressing out a single WAN IP using overload works great I am now reconfiguring things so one specific LAN subnet will use a different IP from the WAN pool After making the change it looks selected subnet should be using the noted NAT pool but it simply does not pass traffic It looks subnet is in the NAT table and associated the 179 address but it simply does not pass traffic The other VLAN traffic continues to use the main overload just fine Any thought Should I be tweaking the prefix length on the NAT pool lines maybe interface GigabitEthernet00 description outsidepublicIP ip address 2072233178 255255255248 small public range ip nat outsideinterface GigabitEthernet01 description inside multiple VLANs behind this segment ip address 192168254254 2552552550 ip nat insideip accesslist extended ACLNAT100 permit ip 1921681000 000255 anyip accesslist extended ACLNAT200 permit ip 1921682000 000255 anyroutemap NAT100 permit 10 match ip address ACLNAT100routemap NAT200 permit 20 match ip address ACLNAT200ip nat inside source routemap NAT100 pool POOL100 overloadip nat inside source routemap NAT200 pool POOL200 overloadip nat pool POOL100 18470155178 2072233178 prefixlength 29  Main overload IP for all internal VLANs minus the issolated 1921682000ip nat pool POOL200 18470155179 2072233179 prefixlength 29 would like all 1921682000 subnet traffic to use this WAN IPPublic IP Ranges 2072233178  2072233180 Gatway 2072233177Subnet Mask 255255255248,Hello first of all you have no layer 3 interface with an IP address in the 192168100024 and 192168200024 range What default gateway are your clients using  If you configure these addresses as secondary address on your inside NAT interface at least the router knows what to translate interface GigabitEthernet01 description inside multiple VLANs behind this segment ip address 192168254254 2552552550 ip address 1921681001 2552552550 secondary ip address 1921682001 2552552550 secondary ip nat inside Once you have done that your NAT pools dont look right ip nat pool POOL100 18470155178 2072233178 prefixlength 29  Main overload IP for all internal VLANs minus the issolated 1921682000ip nat pool POOL200 18470155179 2072233179 prefixlength 29 would like all 1921682000 subnet traffic to use this WAN IP Are these typos  It should look like this ip nat pool POOL100 2072233178 2072233178 prefixlength 29  Main overload IP for all internal VLANs minus the issolated 1921682000ip nat pool POOL200 2072233179 2072233179 prefixlength 29 would like all 1921682000 subnet traffic to use this WAN IP RVCE Hi George Sorry about the confusion correct it was just a typo What you corrected is indeed the syntax used The L3 portion is good and is presently running fine The two routable IPs are from the same block as you can see so the we simply have a single default route It gets interesting When I implement and test the 200 trying to ping an Internet destination the show ip nat trans shows it has create the table It is in the table but passing traffic does not work ISR1sh ip nat tran  i 2072233179icmp 20722331790 1921682002540 42250 42250 If I leave the 1921682000 entry in the ACL that is used for 2072233178 ICMP passes just fine using the overload  pool for the 178 IPISR1 sh log  i 4225011132 Oct 15 205139263 PST NAT i icmp 192168200254 0  4225 0 64564011133 Oct 15 205139263 PST NAT s1921682002542072233178 d4225 64564011152 Oct 15 205139295 PST NAT o icmp 4225 0  2072233178 0 51211011153 Oct 15 205139295 PST NAT s4225 d2072233178192168200254 51211 When I remove 1921682000 from the 2072233178 ACL so it is forced to used the 179 route mapit does build a NAT table but does not pass trafficISR1 sh log  i 4225011518 Oct 15 205253680 PST NAT i icmp 192168200254 0  4225 0 64583011519 Oct 15 205253680 PST NAT s1921682002542072233179 d4225 64583011612 Oct 15 205256688 PST NAT i icmp 192168200254 0  4225 0 64586011613 Oct 15 205256688 PST NAT s1921682002542072233179 d4225 64586 Not sure what the i s and o represent RVCE Hello post the full configuration you might be missing something else RVCE Hi Merlin ip nat pool POOL100 18470155178 2072233178 prefixlength 29  Main overload IP for all internal VLANs minus the issolated 1921682000ip nat pool POOL200 18470155179 2072233179 prefixlength 29 would like all 1921682000 subnet traffic to use this WAN IP I am wondering what are 18470155178179 addresses Since your ISP provides you with 29 the following two configs should work for you I do not run my tests though ip nat pool POOL100 2072233178 2072233178 prefixlength 32 ip nat pool POOL200 2072233179 2072233180 prefixlength 31 HTH Meheretab

Help on BGP timers,Hi all I need help on the below issue  Assuming default BGP timers being used in a MPLS IPVPN network How long does it take to withdraw affected routes from routing table of remote CEs if WAN BGP peer of one CE in the same VRF goes down Suggest some show commands to verify the result,If BGP keepalive time is set to x usually holddown time is 3x Once your neighbor goes down it could take up to 3x units usu seconds for the router to declare the neighbor down and flush its routes Thanks RVCE  rais Thanks for the replyCan anyone give some commands where i can verify thisThanks so much RVCE Thats right but widthdrawn propagation form PE to remote CE has also to be take in account Considering that BGP process has a minimal interval between update 30sec by default I think in the worst case BGP update sent immediatly before CE neighborship goes down it could take an extra time equal to 30  numeroofhop between PE and remote CE Bye enrico  RVCE Thx so much guys May i know which commands to check these i am not able to locate them Please share some commands to how to verify this Thanks so much RVCE Hi you can check the timers negotiated with a neighbour using show ip bgp neighbour ip Es R1sh ip bgp neigh 192168122BGP neighbor is 192168122 remote AS 65002 external link BGP version 4 remote router ID 10222 BGP state  Established up for 000143 Last read 000043 last write 000042 hold time is 180 keepalive interval is 60 seconds Neighbor capabilities Route refresh advertised and receivedold  new Address family IPv4 Unicast advertised and received Message statistics InQ depth is 0 OutQ depth is 0 Sent Rcvd Opens 1 1 Notifications 0 0 Updates 1 1 Keepalives 3 3 Route Refresh 0 0 Total 5 5 Default minimum time between advertisement runs is 30 seconds For address family IPv4 Unicast BGP table version 6 neighbor version 60 Output queue size  0 Index 1 Offset 0 Mask 0x2 1 updategroup member Sent Rcvd Prefix activity   Prefixes Current 4 2 Consumes 104 bytes Prefixes Total 4 2 Implicit Withdraw 0 0 Explicit Withdraw 0 0 Used as bestpath na 1 Used as multipath na 0 Outbound Inbound Local Policy Denied Prefixes   Bestpath from this peer 1 na Total 1 0 Number of NLRIs in the update sent max 4 min 4 Minimum time between advertisement runs is 12 seconds Connections established 1 dropped 0 Last reset neverConnection state is ESTAB IO status 1 unread input bytes 0Connection is ECN Disabled Mininum incoming TTL 0 Outgoing TTL 1Local host 192168121 Local port 179Foreign host 192168122 Foreign port 18431Enqueued packets for retransmit 0 input 0 misordered 0 0 bytesEvent Timers current time is 0x2E1DCTimer Starts Wakeups NextRetrans 6 0 0x0TimeWait 0 0 0x0AckHold 6 4 0x0SendWnd 0 0 0x0KeepAlive 0 0 0x0GiveUp 0 0 0x0PmtuAger 0 0 0x0DeadWait 0 0 0x0iss 2368926251 snduna 2368926437 sndnxt 2368926437 sndwnd 16199irs 936357534 rcvnxt 936357712 rcvwnd 16207 delrcvwnd 177SRTT 169 ms RTTO 1204 ms RTV 1035 ms KRTT 0 msminRTT 72 ms maxRTT 328 ms ACK hold 200 ms httpswwwciscocomcenustddocsiosxmliosiproutebgpcommandirgcrbookbgps1htmlwp3502759178 Bye enrico PS rate if useful
Help with 7206VXR,We have 2cisco 7206VXR NPE300 processor revision D with 229376K65536K bytes of memory connected by multilink Weve been losing connetion over the multilink every night It was ok for several years until recently Anyone had any issues like this before To make it come back up we can go to the local 7204 and telnet to the remote over a ds0 that is not in the multilink We configured one ds0 out of the ds1 for the purpose of bringing the link back up The multilink goes down and we cant get it back up otherwise There is a ds1 in multilink  The ios is c7200jk2smz12127bE3bin The

this point 1 Are the multilink interfaces updown when this happens 2 Do you see the input  output counters at the local site increment in any way 3 Prior to sshing to the remote have you tried to just ping across the link to see if that wakes the remote up 4  While down does a debug ppp data or events provide any insight 5 Was the logging buffer empty I would assume there would be something about the OSPF neighbors or interfaces going down If not enabled then enable logging on both devices logging buffered informational 6 Can you check the T3 controllers to make sure they are clean clear counters if necessary 7 How long have the routers been up A reload may just do the trick Thats all I have for now RVCE I will be able to look at this tonight Thanks for the suggestions RVCE 1 The multilinks are up when it happens 2 Counters are incrementing 3 Pinging does bring it up too 4 I didnt get a chance to do debug while it was down yet Will try it tomorrow 5 Logging is enabled and it shows the line protocol going down Seems to point to service provider 6 Controllers look clean 7 The routers have only been up one week I believe a coworker tried a reload RVCE It could very well be a service provider issue In normal operation are OSPF neighbors established And what is their state when it is down
Can ping internet from router but not l3 switchclients,Hi all Im working towards my CCENTCCNA and have a lab setup with 2 3750s and an 1841 router For this question Im only using one of the switches and the router Im also using a small netgear router so my roommate can continue to have internet access while I test things out I have my 1841 router connected via f01 to my netgear router and from the netgear out to my isp The 3750 is connected in f101 to f00 on the router My IPs are included in the network diagram picture The problem Im running into is this I can ping my ISPs interface and all the way to the internet8888 from my 1841 but I cannot ping even even to my ISPs interface102001201 from the switch or any clients Previously I wasnt even able to ping my netgear routers interface19216811 with my switch but I resolved that by creating a static route in the netgear to 10000 24 19216816 Here are my configs any help would be greatly appreciated RouterCurrent configuration  1132 bytesversion 124service timestamps debug datetime msecservice timestamps log datetime msecno service passwordencryptionhostname R1bootstartmarkerbootendmarkerno aaa newmodelresource policymmi pollinginterval 60no mmi autoconfigureno mmi pvcmmi snmptimeout 180ip subnetzeroip cefno ip dhcp use vrf connectedno ip ips denyaction ipsinterfaceinterface FastEthernet00 ip address 10001 2552552550 ip nat inside ip nat enable ip virtualreassembly duplex auto speed autointerface FastEthernet01 ip address dhcp ip nat outside ip nat enable ip virtualreassembly duplex auto speed autointerface Serial000 no ip address no fairqueueinterface Serial010 no ip addressip classlessno ip route static intervrfip route 0000 0000 19216811ip route 1010100 2552552550 10002ip route 1010200 2552552550 10002ip route 19216810 2552552550 19216811ip http serverno ip http secureservercontrolplaneline con 0 logging synchronousline aux 0line vty 0 4 logging synchronous loginend SwitchCurrent configuration  4120 bytes Last configuration change at 181654 Central Sat Oct 14 2017 NVRAM config last updated at 113219 Central Sat Oct 14 2017version 122no service padservice timestamps debug datetime msecservice timestamps log datetime msecservice passwordencryptionhostname S1bootstartmarkerbootendmarkerno aaa newmodelclock timezone Central 5switch 1 provision wsc375024psystem mtu routing 1500ip routingip dhcp excludedaddress 1010100 10101049ip dhcp excludedaddress 1010200 10102049ip dhcp pool VLAN10 network 1010100 2552552550 defaultrouter 1010101 dnsserver 6978819 6978818 4422 8888 domainname Lowreylocal lease 0 5ip dhcp pool VLAN20 network 1010200 2552552550 domainname Lowreylocal defaultrouter 1010201 dnsserver 6978819 6978818 4422 8888 lease 0 5spanningtree mode pvstspanningtree extend systemidvlan internal allocation policy ascendinginterface FastEthernet101 description TRUNKTOR1 no switchport ip address 10002 2552552550interface FastEthernet102 switchport access vlan 10 switchport mode access spanningtree portfast Interfaces 10323 have nothing plugged into theminterface FastEthernet1024 description TRUNKTOS2 switchport trunk encapsulation dot1q switchport mode trunkinterface GigabitEthernet101interface GigabitEthernet102interface Vlan1 ip address 101011 2552552550interface Vlan10 description WIREDDEFAULTGATEWAY ip address 1010101 2552552550interface Vlan20 ip address 1010202 2552552550ip defaultgateway 1020012091ip classlessip route 0000 0000 10001ip route 19216810 2552552550 19216816ip route 19216810 2552552550 10001ip http serverip http secureserverline con 0 logging synchronousline vty 0 4 loginline vty 5 15 loginend,Please close this one as it is a duplicate of httpssupportforumsciscocomt5wanroutingandswitchingcanpinginternetfromrouterbutnotl3switchclientsmp3198837Thank you
Redistribute EIGRP to OSPF  Which interface to use,I am currently studying CCNP Route and doing some labs here in Digitaltut website Kindly enlighten me which interface should I choose to be the reference for the redistribution for R3f00 or f10 I tried to use the parameters of f10 and I can still ping the loopback I wonder why did they use f00 as a reference redistribute ospf 1 metric 100000 100 255 1 1500Type escape sequence to abortTracing the route to 1721610011 19216812 4 msec 4 msec 0 msec2 19216823 8 msec 20 msec 24 msec3 19216844 40 msec 20 msec 36 msecredistribute ospf 1 metric 100000 10 255 1 1500Tracing the route to 1721610011 19216812 0 msec 0 msec 0 msec2 19216823 8 msec 24 msec 24 msec3 19216844 36 msec 48 msec 36 msec Here is the whole lab setuphttpwwwdigitaltutcomospfeigrpredistributelab,Hi Adrian Kindly enlighten me which interface should I choose to be the reference for the redistribution for R3 f00 or f10 Generally when you redistribute between different protocols you will define your metrics For example when you redistribute from OSPF to EIGRP you need to select values for Bandwidth Delay Load Reliability MTU as EIGRP calculates cost based on composite metric In your setup they select redistribute ospf 1 metric 10000 100 255 1 1500 The default K values for EIGRP are 1 0 1 0 0 so the deciding values are Bandwidth and Delay In the real world you need to carefully consider the K values as they could impact the route it takes HTH Meheretab RVCE Hello I am unclear on what you are asking Which parameters are you referring to  RVCE Sorry for the confusion I mean for the R3 configuration they use the interface fa00 for redistribution I tried to use the interface of fa10 parameters and still able to reach the loopback why did they use the interface of R3 fa00 Lab set up httpwwwdigitaltutcomrouteeigrpospfredistributionsim RVCE They do not specifically use fa00 parameters They assigned those specific values to calculate the cost using composite metric The default values are K11 K31 and K2K4K50 which makes the cost calculation to be dependent on bandwidth and delay only One thing to remember is that whether you use the above values or different parameters associated with fa01 you will be able to reach the loopback address from R1 as far as redistribution from OSPF is successful The path it takes could be different though depending on the cost and the alternate routesHTHMeheretab
Quick Discussion on ASA 5505 Static ARP,Hey everyone  I just have a quick questionobservation that I was wondering if anyone had any input onCisco Adaptive Security Appliance Software Version 916 Device Manager Version 752Hardware ASA5505 512 MB RAM CPU Geode 500 MHzInternal ATA Compact Flash 128MBBIOS Flash M50FW016  0xfff00000 2048KBThis platform has a Base licenseI have a single VLAN single subnet home network behind a 5505 that receives a public outside address via DHCP from as ISP the ASA is my internal DHCP server I understand that the ASA does not support address reservations and have tried to use a static ARP as a workaround  as suggested by many posts on the Goggle machinedhcpclient clientid interface outsidedhcp address 192168111192168150 insidedhcp dns 8888 8844 interface insidedhcp enable insidearp inside 19216812 xxxxxxxxxxxxarp timeout 14400 It seems that even with the static ARP the DHCP server overrides the layer 3 configuration and my xxxxxxxxxxxx machine receives an IP address in the DHCP pool regardless I’m also perplexed by the fact that I’m trying to reserve an address outside the DHCP pool – the ASA is flat out ignoring the static ARPAnyway this is obviously extremely annoying and I was wondering if anyone else has seen this or has any suggestion Thanks,BTW  I have also tried to adjust the DHCP pool range to include the static address I want to reservedhcp address 19216812192168150 insidebut same thing  my xxxxxxxxxxxx machine gets an address other than xxx2 every time
EIGRP flushing default route,Hi for all I have a weird scenario on my network I have a Cat 6880 as a core of a site This switch is connected to two 2921 that are connected with two different MPLS providers On the border routers Im injecting the full routing table of the site to the MPLS and injecting back on the EIGRP just the default route The main issue that I am facing on this scenario is that when one provider comes down on the core of the network both default routes are reset and I face some minutes outage until the network is able to reconverge Any thoughts why this is happening Thanks in advance Daniel FreitasCCIE SP,Could you provide details on the connectivity and L3 routing between the 2921s and the 6880 as well as how the default route is propogated A diagram might be helpful too RVCE Hello chrihusseyAttaching here the topology and the BGPEIGRP configuration of the whole site Thanks in advance for the help RVCE HiPlease check if Router 2 is not preferring the default route through the Core RVCE It is always challenging to redistibute the same route into an IGP at different points on a network In your case it is the default route That is because one end will eventually see the others in the IGP and not inject their route as a result When ISP 1 fails it needs to withdraw the route from BGP and then stop the redistribution into EIGRP The 2921 to ISP 2 then needs to see the default route withdraw from EIGRP before it then redistributes its default route into EIGRPOther may have ideas but if you configure IBGP between the 2921s and the 6880 and redistribute the ISP learned default route into EIGRP at the 6880 you would probably get better performance Hope this makes sense RVCE Hi DanielHave you verified on the core if there is a feasible successor on the core it looks like the Edge router 2 is preferring the default route from the Edge router 1 instead the learned through its ISP Is possible to see the routing table and eigrp topology table just including the default route RVCE This is not the case The VSS is performing the equal cost load balance to the default route sh ip routeCodes L  local C  connected S  static R  RIP M

that your end is converging quick enough and that the delay is in the other side of the MPLS cloud knowing that it is inaccessible via ISP 1 RVCE Both go away Could be but that doesnt explain why both

down and flap again when the ISP is back RVCE Are you sure that both ISP are not using the same path to internet Is the providers advertising the default route You could redistribute the static default route to the Core manually with different metrics RVCE Im originating this default route on my internet exit on the data center and from there propagating the route to both MPLS providers Since I manage my own CEs Im pretty sure that the providers are not influencing the process at all RVCE Need clarification regarding the default route The configs supplied only show redistribution of BGP into EIGRP with a route map The assumption was that that was how the default route got into EIGRPCan you explain what you mean by saying that you originate the default route on the internet exit Is it a BGP route from the MPLS provider a static route etcThanks
BGP Configuration with two ISP,Hi Please help in achiving the scenario discribed below We want to configure BGP with two different ISPWhat would be the prerequisite for thisOur requiremnet is to load balance the load of internal traffic tooWe have IP block of 16 IPs from one ISP and need the reachablility of these public IPs from different ISPWould Each ISP provide their Private AS no or only AS no from One ISP can workElse we have to go with Public AS noI am not able to work on this scenario due to not very well knowledge of BGP Your help is really appreciated Please ask if any other information is required,Hi do you have 1 router with 2 ISP links or 2 routers with 1 link each  this may help you  its design guide look at the section below for BGP it will give you an idea of the config setup  AS and how to share accross multiple paths  you will need to engage both ISPs anyway  you should setup a call with them Load Sharing When DualHomed to One ISP Through Multiple Local Routers Load Sharing When DualHomed to One Internet Service Provider ISP Through a Single Local Router httpswwwciscocomcenussupportdocsipbordergatewayprotocolbgp1376240htmlanc27 RVCE Hello in addition to Marks post here is another link with sample topologies and configurations httpshowipbgpcombgpconfigurationsciscohtml
VPN encryption to china not working,Hello expertsWe are having problem from 23 months that our VPN GREIP tunnels getting disconnceted due to encryption from Europe to china Once we remove encryption it works Is anyone else is also facing the same issue or is there any workaround  Thanks in advance,Possibly something being blocked by the Chinese government RVCE Yes i have sites all over China you wont be using encryption is you want to operate there  we cant even do IWAN there due to it using DMVPN  its completely blocked RVCE I think different regions of China have different policies I have two sites in China and I am successfully able to Static VPN them to the US and the UK using the following crypto ipsec ikev1 transformset ESPAES256SHA espaes256 espshahmac crypto ikev1 policy 10 authentication preshare encryption aes256 hash sha group 5 lifetime 86400 That being said I do experience frequent packet loss bursts from time to time 7 loss when routing internationally Ive reported this to the Chinese ISPs and they have basically said there is nothing we can do about international routing problems due to the Government so we recommend soliciting services based in Hong Kong if you need reliable international routing What kind of device are you using as your VPN concentrator on both ends
Altering DNS Proxy over backup link,Hi I have a couple of small customer sites setup with IP SLA and 4G backup links Everything works just fine if the primary link goes down and the default route goes out over 4G However some of these sites use an external DNS filtering product that allow access based on the external IP of the network the request is coming fromIn our case when we fail over to 4G the clients can no longer resolve DNSWe are currently proxying DNS on the router and doing DHCP on the router There is no local server of any kindIs there a best practise way to approach this problem Essentially I need the router to fail over to a different resolver when the primary link is down IP SLA appears to be able to test for DNS resolution but I cant see a way to alter the nameserver,Try configuring multiple nameservers and use ip domain roundrobin It might mitigate the issue Otherwise event script could be usedHTH RVCE The standard to this problem Ive always seen is usually to move external DNS record management for your public services to the ISPs servers and implement a dynamic DNS applianceservice I would imagine that is a costly solution though but Ive never looked into the exact figure to be honest Here is an example Fatpipes SmartDNS service httpwwwfatpipeinccomproductsaddonssmartdnsphp Basic Functionality of FatPipes SmartDNS Failover FatPipes SmartDNS will intelligently sense when a failure occurs and will make adjustments to the DNS replies so it will not resolve host names to the IP addresses that are associated with the connection that is down or unavailable
merge 3 isp lines in to single network,In my office I have 3 ISP 1st Leased line 2 mbps 2nd Leased line 8 mbps broadband 16 mbps I have 2025 userson lan network I want to merge all 3 Isp into single network for better bandwidth and if any onetwo of them disconnecteddown then other network can manage the network Now my question is Can I merge 3 Isp is it a good Idea if not then what is the best Idea for that If yes then what deviceLoad balancerFirewall will I need to achieve this and if anyone can tell me device model number then it will be a great help,I dont know of a way to merge 3 different ISP links into one logicalHowever there are technologies that will dynamically load balance across them For example Ciscos PfR httpciscocomgopfr Different Cisco devices support it Which might be best for you depends on other considerations RVCE I concur with Joseph there is no way to do this The best you are going to get is load balancing Alternatively to PfR if there are 3 separate routers plugging into each of the 3 respective WAN lines and you have a switch connected on the LAN side of all of them you could run Gateway Load Balancing Protocol GLBP if your switch supports it httpsnetworklessonscomciscoccieroutingswitchingglbpgatewayloadbalancingprotocol

UpdatedLayer 3 Routing over VPc Peer Link on N9K with lastest 70 code,Hi I need to use two Nexus 9300 to replace a three unit stacked catalyst 3750 switch for a small datacenter The catalyst switch is the default gateway for local LAN and has eigrp running to peer with two other locations via private WANI have N9K configured for vPC with HSRP to handle the local LAN routing However I am not 100 clear on the layer 3 peering piece as there is only one link from the datacenter to each other locationsHere below is a high level diagram I do have layer3 peerrouter and peergateway enabled for VPc domain as wellSo I know for sure NexusA can peer with RouterA with no issue the same for NexusA and NexusB I think RouterA should also be able to peer with NexusB However I am not certain on thisCan someone help verifyI know the peerlink should not be used for data plane but there is only one link to each other locationThe other option I can think of is to have a transit switch north bound of the N9K which will be connected to the remote locations and dual link to the VPc domain But the potential question will be Do I configure vpc from N9K to the transit switch If so how does NexusA andor NexusB peer with other location via EIGRPAlso as you saw in diagram will those single homed servers communicate with each other eastwest bound What if those single homed servers are on different VLANs will they still be able to communicate Peerlink allows all VLANsThanksS,No one Still waiting for some information here RVCE Hello Shuai As of today the only Nexus that support routing over a vPC VLAN is N7K after 72 release code Please refer to the following documentation httpwwwciscocomcenustddocsswitchesdatacenterswnxosinterfacesconfigurationguidebCiscoNexus7000SeriesNXOSInterfacesConfigurationGuideBookconfiguringvpcshtmlconcept09E6B311898E444CA27CD73CCC2E5BED I am not sure about the road map for Nexus 9K but I can assure that even it may work is not supported design by Cisco in such platform I can look for any plan in the future for this support and get back to you Warm Regards RVCE I thought the layer3 peerrouter command is for thatI guess I would also add a layer2 trunk between the two N9K RVCE Updated and added a new diagram to more assemble what I have in reality RVCE Hi Any update on layer 3 vPC on nexus 9k I have two Nexus 9K s acting as Core switch and this has to have a P2P link to a single 6509 switch I am not sure if this would support or not Thanks
Multiples OSPF process per VRF in IOSXR,HiWe need to implement multiples OSPF process in a single VRF according this configurationrouter ospf 10 vrf TEST routerid 100024 area 0 interface GigabitEthernet0001711 mtuignore enable  router ospf 22 vrf TEST routerid 10025 area 0 interface GigabitEthernet000122 mtuignore enable  But we can’t apply the configuration  Error VRF TEST already exists in OSPF process 10 We have tested it in a 412 IOSXR and 611 IOSXRv our simulator with the same resultWe have implemented this in 317 IOSXE ASR903 and 316 IOSXE in a virtual router without problem Is this a IOXR problem design Is a feature than must be supported Thank you very muchRegards,This is a limitation of IOSXR also present in 531 I mean who would need more than one OSPF process per vrf says nothing about his routers with up to 4 ospf processes in same vrf RVCE Hello our costumers have multiples services with other operators We interconnect this services I mean that we have to connect with operators that define OSPF as protocol So far we use a different OSPF process to receive prefixes and redistribute them in our core OSPF process This way we can control that prefixes inyected by operators are fine They are two possible solutions 1 Use multiples areas 1 operator  1 area The issue is than our IOSxr 412 is not very powerfull to manipulate prefixes and set cost or administrative distances Besides we have to announce only a default route to operators and this makes that area must be nssa We think that this configuration is no very standar for operators and could not be valid 2 Use vrfs 1 operator  1 vrf and redistribute into default table using BGP We are using this solution in other enviroment but we think that perhaps there is a more simple solution We can think that our 412 IOSXR is very old and not very featureriched but in our 611 IOSXRv virtual router there is the same limitation Thank you Regards
Route leaking from global routing table to VRF with staticOSPF,Hi all I have an ASR router terminating multiple guest wireless VRFs but the router is using a single ISP connection housed in the Global Routing Table I require that client subnets within each VRF use the same ISP next hop address within the GRT I found the command below that lets me leak the default route from the GRT to the GUEST vrf for example ASR WAN int  1111ASRISP next hop  1112Client Subnet in GUEST VRF  101010024 When the return traffic from the Internet arrives at the router how do I route it back to the 101010024 within the GUEST VRF Can I simply use What if I was using OSPF to advertise the internal client subnets within each VRF to the ASR router Unfortunately I dont have the ability to test this at the moment its still in design stage Im looking for the absolute easiest way to implement this Dont have the ability to run BGP Any ideas would be greatly appreciated Brett,Hi check this links httpsroutingbitscom20100913vrfliterouteleaking httpswwwciscocomcenussupportdocsmultiprotocollabelswitchingmplsmultiprotocollabelswitchingvpnsmplsvpns47807routeleakinghtmlglobal httpswwwciscocomcenussupportdocsipiprouting200158ConfigureRouteLeakingbetweenGlobalahtml Hope these could help enrico PS rate if useful

Can Cisco IWAN PFR classify the traffic based on Network prefixes,Hi ExpertsI am planning to use Cisco IWAN PFR and i need your advise from expert to know whether PFR can classify the traffic based on the Network prefixes Network addressesI know it can classify based on the DSCP and Application  but we need to classify based on the Network prefixesPlease advise,Hello PFRv3 does not do this but you may remark traffic ingress on LAN per prefix Btw could you explain a business case behind the requirement RVCE Hi  Thanks for confirming it We have a very little visibility on the incoming LAN traffic to our WAN routers and we can only see the IP information and DSCP on those packets and no application or port information We would like to treat each Internal subnets differently  so that they get different priority or WAN Exit based on our policy configuration We have about 10 internal LAN segments that need to be treated differently for thier voice and data traffic All the LAN segments are having EF marking for their voice  so we would like some LAN segment EF packets to use the best link and some land segments to use the second Next best link and same applies for the data traffic We want the flexibility that older version of PFR provided to do some prefix based route optimisation Thanks Nirmal
VPN server behind a Cisco router,We got a Checkpoint 4600 firewall connect to a Cisco router 2900 Cisco router 2900 connect to internet with static public IP address Cisco router configured with NAT my question can remote user use Checkpoint VPN client software to establish VPN connection with that public IP address on Cisco router 2900,Hi Why wouldnt Take a look in TNAT or NAT traversal RVCE NAT Traversal does allow VPN traffic to function when the server is behind an address translatiing device But NAT Traversal by itself does not solve this problem The issue is that the VPN user must use some public address as the destination address in the VPN client So if a VPN packet comes to the public IP of the router then how do we get it to go to the Checkpoint If there were a secnd public IP available then the router could have a static NAT and that could forward the VPN packet to the Checkpoint If there is not a second public IP then the router can be configured to use port forwarding to forward the VPN packet to the Checkpoint If the VPN client treats this as an IPsec VPN then the port forwarding is relatively simple The router would forward any ISAKMP or IPsec packet to the Checkpoint If the VPN client treats this as SSL VPN then the situation is a bit more complicated The router could forward all TCP port 443 traffic to the Checkpoint That would make the VPN work But if there is TCP port 443 traffic that is not VPN HTTPS traffic coming into the network then that traffic would also be forwarded to Checkpoint HTH Rick

httpswwwciscocomcenussupportdocsrouters1700seriesmodularaccessrouters22187pswdrec1700html Hope it is useful  RVCE Hi  Ive tried this method My issue is I cannot type in step 5 Type confreg 0x2142 at the rommon 1 prompt in order to boot from Flash This step bypasses the startup configuration where the passwords are store because the BT password prompt appeard even after pressing BREAK RVCE I would think that if you go through the password recovery process on this 1841 to ignore the startup config that you would have a fresh start with this router Basically the password recovery process is to start the boot process and then interrupt it to get into rommon You set the config register to 0x2142 and then boot the router The config register setting will ignore the startup config and you start with a fresh router As you build a new config on the router remember to set the config register back to the normal setting of 0x2102 HTH Rick RVCE UPDATE I removed the compact flash card and the router booted in rommon and I can type How can I replace the IOS on the card RVCE I am glad to know that you found a way to get into rommmon and to be able to type That means that you should be able to bypass the startup config and essentially to start over fresh with the router Can I ask why you would want to replace the IOS on the card It is certainly possible to replace the IOS but the first step would be to have a version of IOS as the replacement Getting a new version of IOS code from Cisco requires a maintenance contract And it is not clear whether you have a maintenance contract for this router HTH Rick RVCE Hi I couldnt use rommon when the compact flash card was installed because of a security feature BT seem to have installed on it I wanted to reinstall the IOS because it would have hopefully got rid of the BT security features ROMMON with out the compact flash doesnt appear to work properly either D Thanks for the help RVCE Thanks for the explanation Before I try to answer about the flash card may I ask whether you were successful in changing the config register to 0x2142 And if so did that allow you to build a new config on the router There are many discussions of upddating the flash card by removing it from the router and using the flash card with a card reader on your PC Before we go deeper into that we need to clarify whether you would be able to get a new version of IOS for that routerDo you have a maintenance contract that would entitle you to a new version of IOS HTH Rick
IWAN Spoke with DSL asymmetric transport bandwidth Interface bandwidth best practice,Hi Everyone I have an IWAN customer with multiple spokes and two types of transport MPLS  WWW The spoke sites have various combinations of leased line symmetrical bandwidth and asymmetrical DSL4G Eg 1Mbps up 10Mbps down My question is around best practice when setting interface bandwidth on DMVPN tunnel interfaces Heres a snippet from the IWAN design guide FYI The physical interface bandwidth setting should be set to match the bandwidth of the respective transport which should correspond to the actual interface speed or if you are using a subrate service use the policed rate from the carrier So my question is this  Where asymmetrical DSL based services are present should I set the spoke DMVPN Tunnel bandwidth to the upstream As I have at the moment or the downstream Obviously the downstream is higher but if I use that value I would imagine I could run the risk flooding the upstream when IWAN load sharing is enabled I have tried setting the following but IWAN only seems to pay attention to the upstream 1000kbps Does this mean im not able to make use of all the available downstream DSL bandwidth interface TunnelXXdescription DSL Interface bandwidth 1000 bandwidth receive 6000 I cant find any documentation around this so if anyone could help point me in the right direction I would really appreciate it Thanks a lot Matt Solved Go to Solution,Hello On a spoke under the tunnel you specify upstream bandwidth  this hints PFR on how much it may put to the interface On the Hub with pertunnel QoS you shape to spokes downstream rate minus 10 RVCE Hello On a spoke under the tunnel you specify upstream bandwidth  this hints PFR on how much it may put to the interface On the Hub with pertunnel QoS you shape to spokes downstream rate minus 10 RVCE Thanks for the reply Very hepful Can I ask another IWAN related question please Is it possible to configure an MCBR spoke specific policy I do realise that IWAN is designed around the central MCs policy But I was just interested if there was any way to override the Hub MCs policy at a specific spoke if required And if so could it cause issues Thanks RVCE Hello Its not possible to specify spokespecifi policy Its possible starting from iWAN 221 to specify interdc policy per transit site Best regards RVCE Why minus 10

How to break password of Cisco 3750 switch without rebooting,,Nikhilkhandekar wroteIs there any way where I could break the password and take the configuration backup without rebooting the switch  Tell the HR to call him and inform him that his FF full and final settlement wont be done unless he share the password Its a simple trick and work most of the time Only catch here is that they should call him before his FF is done One of the other options to recover password is provided here httpswwwciscocomcenustddocsswitcheslancatalyst3750softwarerelease12225secconfigurationguide3750scgswtrblhtmlwp1021182 httpswwwciscocomcenustddocsswitcheslancatalyst3750softwarerelease12255seconfigurationguidescg3750swtrblhtml25330 Also try your luck by accessing switch via the consol port TRY Hope thats helpful Regards Moses RVCE NO all password recovery procedures require you to  reboot the switch interrupt the boot process boot without loading the configuration hence without the password the best option left is if you have physical access tot the console port and try if there is no login enabled on the console but i guess you already tried that without luck other strategy could be using a second stack memberthis does not break the password but you can retrieve the configuration also you can replace the switch with a switch with a known password  prepare a switch with NO configuration preferrably the same ios version as the existing switch  add this switch to the stack as member 2 remove stack member 2 now you have a switch with a copy of the configuration of the complete stack including the configuration of member 1 do password recovery on member 2 and viewsave the configuration if desired modify member 2 to replace member 1 renumber switch etc RVCE A dictionary or brute force could but this will take time Id rather say that the switch crashed and perform the password recovery

msGMPGEOll RVCE Hello in addition to the other posts check the CPU utilization of your HP switches Also the firewall if that is in between the source and destination could add a delay which might cause the PING to timeout Try to send it wth a higher than the default 2 seconds interval eg 3 seconds RVCE I try but same I made rule for ICMP in firewall but still the same ping output f RVCE I have seen the symptom where every other ping fails when there were two paths toward the destination in the routing table but only one of them worked But according to the routing table output that was posted that is not the case I have also seen this symptom when a device was performing rate limiting Is it possible that the Barracuda is doing rate limiting on the pings from the router HTH Rick RVCE In addition to what have been said above the problem could be on the HP Switch side Please ping from the HP switch using vlans interface as source and share the output HTH Meheretab RVCE Thank u for

for the additional output This is a puzzling situation Results of Ping between Cisco and Barracuda seems to be ok Results of Ping between Cisco ad HP differs depending on the direction of the ping Ping from Cisco to HP both to the 200250 interface and the vlan interfaces drops 50  of the packets But ping from those interfaces on HP to Cisco are 100  successful As I mentioned in a previous response one thing that can produce this 50  drop result is multiple routes in the routing table But if that were the case I would expect that it would affect traffic in both directions So I am left believing that the issue is likely something on the Barracuda I know that many firewalls treat traffic differently if it is originated outside and going to inside than it treats traffic from outside that is a response to something inside This leads me to wonder if the Barracuda might be imposing a rate limiting on the ping attempts from Cisco HTH Rick RVCE Did you find a solution If not could you also check the configuration related to ICMP on the HP For example if you have ip icmp burstnormal 1 configured If it is not configured could you try configuring it as ip icmp burstnormal 20 and see the resultHTHMeheretab RVCE hello Thank u for your answer I have configured but same result I opened case on barracuda support and they said that it is firewall rate limit but the colud not solved problem RVCE Thank you for the update

everything is okI have checked internet speed from website speedtestnet and it gives about download 08 Mbitssec and upload 04MbitssecHowever my internet connection is 2MbitssecAlso how to verify it from checking directly from routerAlso in case of any failure in internet connectionHow to check router logs to find out reason of failure RVCE HelloYou are welcomeRegarding the connection speed  try issuing the show dsl interface atm 0 and post the results here This command displays information about the physical parameters of the DSL connection Some vital information may be present there Also in general the pages that measure the alleged speed are often notorious for being imprecise Try downloading a large file from a server that has no performance bottlenecks itself for examplehttpwwwkernelorgpublinuxkernelv30linux345tarbz2In general it is not possible to verify the download speed from the router itself The router can tell you about the operation mode of the DSL line and about selected parameters that affect its speed limits however performance tests have to be done from a standalone PCRegarding the logging again the router is not going to store detailed infomation about why the connection failed In many cases it does not even know It is up to you to use various show and debug commands to narrow down the possible cause of the outageWould you mind posting your current configuration again Remove the passwords thoughBest regardsPeter RVCE Hi guys im too i have my speed low after configure my 1801 normaly the speed average is around 10 to 9 mbps but with cisco router the max speed that we get is 6 to 7 mbps do you have any idea Best regards Cahrlie RVCE Hi thank you its working even with ROUTER cisco 800 Thank you for the configuration have a good day
Att ASE Network Upgrade,Hello everyone So I was recently informed we will be migrating from an Att IPFLEX network to a new ASE network We have 16 locations which are stub networks all pointing back to the corporate location Normally this wouldnt be a big deal except as part of the negotiationscost savings it was decided that Att will provide a copper handoff to our equipment and remove their PE equipment We are already doing BGP routing on all routers but now I am wondering if we will need to incorporate an MPLS configuration Not sure if any of you have gone through this upgrade or are currently running the ASE but any advice would be much appreciated ThanksBigMac,
Packet Tracer IPv6 routing,Hello everyoneIm new to the forums so Im in your care  Im in a bit of a pinch you see Im trying to get a network working with only IPv6 thus far Ive been able to give everything their respective IPv6 addresses but I cant seem communicate between 2 routers on a copper crossover connection The file has been added so if you could take a look Id appreciate that a bunch Ive tried using RIPng but whenever I use show ipv6 routenothing will be labeled as R The file has been labeled as jpeg due to the fact that the forum wont accept the format pktJust rewrite the extension from jpeg to pkt packet tracer will be able to work with it,Hi The only two IPv6 addresses I see in your diagram are the 2001db8aaaa164 and 2001db8bbbb164 and seem to be both configured on the link between the two routers These addresses are not part of the same subnet first 64 bits are different which is probably why you are having issues Can you ping from one router to the other using the link local address Regards Harold RitterSr Technical LeaderCCIE 4168 RS SPharoldciscocomMéxico móvil 52 1 55 8312 4915Cisco MéxicoPaseo de la Reforma 222Piso 19Cuauhtémoc JuárezCiudad de México 06600México RVCE Hello for the sake of simplicity I have reconfigured your network for IPv6 only have a look at the config for reference RVCE Hello for the sake of simplicity I have reconfigured your network for IPv6 only have a look at the config for reference
Site A and B with backdoor link connected to MPLS with different AS,Hello Two sites are connected to L3 MPLS with different AS We are doing eBGP with the provider and doing OSPF redistribution from BGP on the backend There is also dark fiber between the two sites that is used as a backdoor link I would like to make on site A primary and have all traffic from both locations using backdoor link go in and out of the two sites Site B will be used in an event of MPLS failure at site A Any suggestions please on how to accomplish this task without changing both sites to use the same AS and then simply prepend AS number from site B to make it less preferable I would like to stay and use different AS numbers at each location Thanks in advance,Hello I think your question is somewhat unclear Can you draw out your current setup and indicate what you are trying to accomplish  RVCE Hi Is the backdoor link being used with any IGP or static routes

Traceroute and Request time out,Why do i receive request time out in the middle of a traceroute what does that means Solved Go to Solution,Meenakshi I believe that a different explanation is more likely the cause of your issue If your source IP address is not permitted at certain hops as suggested by Jong then how does the traffic get past those hops without being droppedTo explain what is happening we should start by reviewing how traceroute works Traceroute sends packets to find the path through the network to the destination Traceroute manipulates the TTL of the packet The first set of probe packets has TTL set to 1 And so at the first hop the TTL expires the first hop router discards the packet and generates an ICMP error message This ICMP error message is what identifies the address of the first hop Traceroute receives the ICMP error or if it does not receive the ICMP error message then Traceroute has a timeout Then traceroute increments the TTL and sends packets with TTL of 2 The packet gets to the second hop where it expires and the second hop generates an ICMP error message The error message identifies the second hop in the path Traceroute continues to increment the TTL and to look for the ICMP error messages to identify the hop until the packet reaches the destination or until the traceroute gets to the max number of hopsIf some hops along the path do not send the ICMP error message then this is what generates the timeout in traceroute Some providers configure their routers to not generate the ICMP error message because of a security concern and the desire to not provide identifying information about their public routers I believe that this is a much more likely reason for some timeouts along the way in your tracerouteHTHRick RVCE If the traceroutes completed It could be your source ip address is not permitted on that particular hops to sendreceived ICMP packetsRegardsJong RVCE Meenakshi I believe that a different explanation is more likely the cause of your issue If your source IP address is not permitted at certain hops as suggested by Jong then how does the traffic get past those hops without being droppedTo explain what is happening we should start by reviewing how traceroute works Traceroute sends packets to find the path through the network to the destination Traceroute manipulates the TTL of the packet The first set of probe packets has TTL set to 1 And so at the first hop the TTL expires the first hop router discards the packet and generates an ICMP error message This ICMP error message is what identifies the address of the first hop Traceroute receives the ICMP error or if it does not receive the ICMP error message then Traceroute has a timeout Then traceroute increments the TTL and sends packets with TTL of 2 The packet gets to the second hop where it expires and the second hop generates an ICMP error message The error message identifies the second hop in the path Traceroute continues to increment the TTL and to look for the ICMP error messages to identify the hop until the packet reaches the destination or until the traceroute gets to the max number of hopsIf some hops along the path do not send the ICMP error message then this is what generates the timeout in traceroute Some providers configure their routers to not generate the ICMP error message because of a security concern and the desire to not provide identifying information about their public routers I believe that this is a much more likely reason for some timeouts along the way in your tracerouteHTHRick RVCE Your explanation is exactâ¦thanks RVCE Hi Rick Good explanationThanks By the way In regular business world how can we get these ISP related issuesExRequest time outs get sorted If we assume we have a packet loss at 19th Hop when sending packets from Comapany A router to Company B router  1Is that Company A need to contact the ISP and report the failure  2What is the procedure to inform them  Some of the ISPs are in different countries and it will be difficult to find at least their technical support email addresses or the Contact numbers  3Can we escalate the issue to Comapny As ISP provider 
Traffic shaping per client on ISR 4331,Hi all We have a 100Mbps Internet link feeded by 4 proxy nodes The proxies are accessed by around 800 users The point is now I only have four IP addresses as the sources which pass the router But as every single user creates one or more sessions I have around 14000 sessions which pass the routerMy idea now is to shape the traffic so that if one user starts a download of lets say 10GB that after a certain amount of traffic downloaded via one single session the traffic will be throttled to lets say 1Mbps so that not one or two users can use the whole bandwidth Does someone has a config for an ISR4000 router who had a similar issue and who successfully implemented such as a restriction for the download traffic Thanks a lotMarkus Solved Go to Solution,Im unaware of a feature to support that on an ISR 4KOff the topofmyhead the only technology that comes close is something like a 6500s microflow policer RVCE Im unaware of a feature to support that on an ISR 4KOff the topofmyhead the only technology that comes close is something like a 6500s microflow policer RVCE Thanks Joseph for your input Lets see if other tech guys also supports your statement The other idea I had was to put another device in front of the ISR 4k which handles this functionality RVCE Yea again though you might find slim picking for such a featureThe only other devices that might offer something like that would be something designed for the digital DSL or cable usersAnother problem you might run into is being on the outside of your proxies might hide the aggregate bandwidth of all user sessions although you might still be able to target flows

advance,The stub networks must be in the BGP route table for this to work which they wont be if you are only getting a default route Something like this will help router bgp 55555 network 1110 mask

network is not in the network statement there RVCE I dont know what else to say You have a RIB failure Tease me and add the network statements BGP needs to know about it  or you will get a RIB failure RVCE Hi Could you share output of  show ip route 0000 sh ip bgp ribfailure show ip bgp 0000 show ip route connected RVCE I cannot remove both static routes as this a production network I removed one of them the one that leads to the secondary circuit ip route 0000 0000 2222 I added the statement network 2220 in the network statements Routersh ip route 0000Routing entry for 00000 supernet Known

safety RVCE deleted RVCE deleted sorry for the confusion  Youre absolutly correct in being very careful in a production environment However I agree to the suggestion in the other postings to increase the AD of your static defaultroutes 30 should be enough The static defaultroutes then will stay in the routingtable unless the BGProutes become valid floating static routes I really cannot see any risk in this and it will simplify the troubleshooting RVCE sh ip bgp 0000 output show you have default route in BGP routing table receiving from ISP but that routes are not installed in routers routing table its showing receivedonly in output as you may have default routing with better AD Admin distance receiving from other routing protocol like static route or ospfegrp Action Plan  Please remove below static default routes and check the out put sh ip bgp 0000 and sh ip route 0000 ip route 0000 0000 1111 ip route 0000 0000 2222 RVCE This is a production network and I cannot remove the routes without a maintenance But I need to have a solution by that time In the last maintenance I removed the static routes and the default routes were still not being installed they still had the RIBfailure flag and the switch could not get out Can I test this with just removing the second static route and see if that received route will show up I did it today and it still have the r flag The only idea i have right now is to delete all bgp configs and build them again and see what happens RVCE Did you add the network statements for the stub network I suggested I did you change the administrative distance of the default static routes to 220 as I suggested  then they will still work but if BGP starts working it will take precedence RVCE I just changed the AD for the static routes to 220 and the site went down Had to put everything back the way it was immediately Will have to troubleshoot this during the maintenance window RVCE You should avoid dual static default route to multiple ISPs unless youre really aware of potential impact of doing so By default static routes will same AD will load balance traffic across links Anyways To answer your query changing AD for static default routes to 30 would help BGP to install route in table This way you can keep both static and BGP routes Static routes will take precedence when BGP connections are lost Hope this helps Please dont forget to mark this thread answered if helps RVCE During my last maintenance the backup circuit was replaced so that neighbor was built from scratch The route was still not installed I didnt clear the session on the primary neighbor just removed the static route The route is still not being installed There are no ACLs blocking it the ACLs for incoming traffic have only one permit any statement the distribute lists in the neighbor statements I have tried to do everything that was mentioned in this thread in the secondary circuit the route still has a ribfailure flag I did add the network statement for the stub network My next maintenance be will scheduled around midend May I will delete all the bgp configs at that time and add them again
ISIS Protocol Dampening,A hopefully simple question but I cant find much documentation on how to do it Is there a way to dampen the neighbor adjacency of ISIS I know there is interface dampening but I am not referencing that I am referring to scenarios where the adjacency flaps a lot but the interface stays up Is there a slow restart setting or a way to dampen when it bounces enough times,
IWAN Master controller redundancy,HiI am currently looking at implementing an IWAN solution I have a question about the master controller what would basically happen if we lost the master controllerwould we just lose the performance routing and would all traffic stay as is also how is the traffic monitored do the border routers measure the metrics between branch BR and Hub BR and then report to the MC cheers,Its exact the same as with PfR  if you need MC redundancy make it with HSRP or Anycast Loopback For Georedundant MC you then need a way to make an L2 tunnel between the two for HSRP or regular routing metrics for the Anycast RVCE Hello PFRv3 MC HA supports anycast loopback only while HSRP is an option for PFRv2 Also anycast is done not per metric but per prefixlength primary MC advertises 32 and standby  31 prefix Best regards
LOAD BALANCE service to 2 servers using etherchannel,I am unabel to find an example of how to LB service between 2 servers using a 3750 It seems etherchannle sis mostly for switch to switch Does anyone have an example config 1 IP to 2 servers,In that case would the LB not be done on the server side  you can alter the LB on switch side but the only option are whats available with portchannel load balance command in global config RVCE Yes this ive read my dilema is when creating the portchannel you give it an ip address and you configure the LB ports with channelgroup but on server side what ip addess is given to NICs cisco IP Server1 IP etc WWW ciscoserver1 NIC server2 NIC RVCE Could you not use a layer 2 portchannel on switch side  add the the vlan to the etherchannel po and its member ports and then give the server nics ips in that vlan range and then set the LB on server side another option i persume if your going l3 the nics would need to be in that po subnet range you use on switch side so they can communicate and subnet then routed  our server or chassis based blade servers are all done in L2 and trunked up to the core then routed there at the l3 vss RVCE I know how to LB using proxys etc I was hoping cisco could LB internaly RVCE Only other feature Im aware of on a 3750 is NLB which is a feature that works with load balancing on Microsoft servers never used it before though but its available on few platformsNetwork Load Balancing NLB technology is used to distribute client requests across a set of servers
Multihoming BGP and static route,Hi friendsIm using 2 ISPs ISPA and ISPB have my own block of public IP addresses 170XX022 and my ASN 26XX25 Im using a Cisco ASR1001X Router Besides I have a BGP session established with ISPB and ISPA is using default route in a few days I should have BGP with this ISP too I need to make ISPB my primary provider and pass all my traffic through it but right now all my traffic is through ISPA even when I have in my ASR a static route to ISPB ip route 0000 0000 187XX112 where 187XX112 is the gateway for ISPB A couple days ago ISPA went down and I losted internet access even when my ISPB were up Is it possible what I want to do Can anybody help me please Thanks in advance Solved Go to Solution,Gaspar We are making progress Now we see that you are advertising your network to ISP BNow there is a question about whether ISP B is advertising your network to the Internet Can you ask them about that At this point your BGP appears to be doing what it should An output shown in an earlier part of this thread shows that you are learning 1 route from ISP B I assume that this would be a default route Now you are advertising your network to ISP B Learning a default route from ISP B and advertising your network to them is what you want BGP to do And at some point you want BGP to do the same things with ISP A When that happens we can be fairly confident that you will have failover and failback working so that if one ISP goes down that your network will continue to operate using the surviving ISP You have asked this question a few times can I access to internet obviously through ISPB if my ISPA goes down  That will be easy to answer when both ISP are using BGP But it is complicated when one ISP uses BGP and the other ISP is using static routes There are at least two things that make this complicated 1 ISP A seems to be advertising your network to the Internet What happens to that advertisement if ISP A stops working If the link from you to ISP A stops working would ISP A stop advertising your network If ISP continues to advertise your network to the Internet but can not forward traffic to you then your failover will not work note that this issue is resolved when both ISP are using BGP 2 You have a static route for outbound traffic which currently sends traffic through ISP B What would happen if that link stopped working or if the router at ISP B stopped working The usual way to handle this is to implement IP SLA to track the static route and to remove it from the routing table if the next hop is no longer reachable Note that you have a similar issue if you have a backup static route to the other ISP Note that this issue is resolved when both ISP are using BGP So perhaps there is a questin about how quickly you are likely to get BGP running with ISP A And perhaps a question about whether it is worth much effort to fix failover in the current environment with ISP A using static if you will soon be able to use BGP for both ISP HTH Rick RVCE Hello post the config of your router With static routes you could use an IP SLA If we see your configuration we can make suggestions RVCE here you goContencion1001Xsh

route entries by running sh ip route If you do not learn andor use any route from ISPB then that will explain why you were having outage when ISPA was downAlso do not forget how routers route traffic Routes with longest match are preferred even if different protocols are used If the prefix length are the same then you will need to look at the AD of the route Static routes AD is 1 and eBGPs AD is

route will be preferred for any unknow destination If you are going to use BGP peering with both ISP you can use the BGP attributes to manipulate the traffic and prefer a path over other You can use

configuration your router will prefer the path through the ISPB because it will have a higher Weight also you will have symmetric traffic because you are advertising the local network with lowest ASPath preprend Also you could be receiving a default route and redistribute it into an IGP Now if your router is connected to Internet you can avoid become your router in transit this link can explain that behavior httpwwwburningnodecom20130720bgppreventbeingatransitas Hope it is useful RVCE hi Julio I understand perfectly what you´re saying but all that´s in case I use BGP with both providers what should be working in a few days from now But right now when I´m using BGP with ISPB and static routes with ISPA is it possible for me to pass all my traffic through ISPB  that´s my main concern right now because ISPA is a little bit unstable Thanks RVCE HiIf you are configuring default static routes you can configure ISPA with lower AD and configure IP SLA It will force all of your traffic to be send to ISPB and when the connection is down which you will monitor using track objects the backup default route through ISPA will be activeHTHMeheretab RVCE Im going to try what you

when I shutdown interface connected to ISPA I lost connection to internet Any ideas on how to solve this RVCE Gaspar Thank you for the additional information I believe that I now understand at least part of what is causing your issue You are running BGP with ISP B and forming the BGP neighbor relationship But you are not advertising your network to ISP B there is no network statement or any redistribution in your BGP configuration If you are not advertising your network to ISP B then they can not advertise your network to the Internet Obviously ISP A knows about your network based on static routes and seems to be advertising your network to the Internet That explains why all Internet traffic to you is coming through ISP A and why you lose connectivity to the Internet if ISP A goes down This could be resolved if you advertise your network to ISP B HTH Rick RVCE ok thanks Rick and please can you tell me how can I advertise my network to ISP B Thanks RVCE There are two parts of getting BGP to advertise your network First you need to add a network statement in your router bgp config which would look like network 170xx0 netmask 2552552520 This will advertise your 170xx0 network as long as BGP sees a matching entry in your routing table So the second part would be to configure a static route for your network which might look something like this ip route 170xx0 2552552520 null0 If you do these two things then BGP should advertise your network HTH Rick RVCE sorry my friend but it didnt work I have this on my ASR router bgp 26XX25 bgp routerid 187XX113 bgp logneighborchanges network 170XX0 mask 2552552520 neighbor 187XX112 remoteas 13XX9 neighbor 187XX112 password 7 104352154 neighbor 187XX112 softreconfiguration inbound and ip route 0000 0000

ISPB you need to advertise only your network Is your network 172XX022 If not please replace the above two networks with the correct maskAlso you can use one of the free servers in httpswwwnetdigixcomservershtml or any other route servers to check how does the rest of the world reaches to your network What factors you can change to affect the route Or you can provide us your

Shaping the Traffic to Limit the Bandwidth toward ISP,HelloWe are planning the deploy shaping to limit the traffic toward the ISP and we have a gig interface which is connected to Cisco 7609  ISPI would like to limit the traffic 250Mbps anything above gets queued and dropped The ISP is not limiting the traffic if it is Oversubscribed they will charge us lots of moneySo Im preparing the configuration and required your comment on itThe connection between my router and the ISP is a gig interfaceI ended up doing thisClassmap ratelimit250Mmatch anyPolicymap ratelimit250MMatch class ratelimit250MShape average 250000000ExitInterface range gi91011Servicepolicy input ratelimit250MServicepolicy output ratelimit250MPlease share your thoughts and findings if Im missing anythingAny other recommendationsAnything I can do to help with the output drops I thought the shaping would help,Hi Muhammad This is the config that I typically use for outbound traffic shaping to my ISPs policymap parent class classdefault shape average 250000000  interface GigabitEthernetXX servicepolicy output parent A couple of notes 1 You can match all traffic under classdefault instead of creating a dedicated classmap that matches any traffic 2 I don’t think the 7609 supports inbound traffic shaping so your input servicepolicy may not work This shouldn’t be an issue as you only want prevent egress traffic towards your ISP from exceeding your CIR 3 Some devices don’t count L2 overhead so I typically reduce the shaped rate by 10 to take L2 overheads into consideration Example config below You will need to monitor this and adjust if required policymap parent class classdefault shape average 225000000 900000 A certain level of output drops will be normal and TCP traffic will adjust its transmission rate to compensate You could look at increasing the depth of the shaping queue to reduce drops however this will increase latency which will have an impact if you run latency sensitive applications over your internet connection Another option is to use a nested CBWFQ policy to provide minimum bandwidth guarantees and reduce drops for specific applications I hope that this helps RVCE Hi Willwetherman Thank you for the reply and as you said shaping doesnt support on module WSF6700DFC3C so apply policying on the interface as following classmap matchall ratelimit250Mmatch any policymap ratelimit250Mclass ratelimit250Mpolice cir 249000000 conformaction transmit exceedaction drop interface GigabitEthernetxxdescription  ISPA primary servicepolicy output ratelimit250Mend Outputs PE7609XXX0101show policymap interface gigabitEthernet 910 GigabitEthernet910 Servicepolicy output ratelimit250M classmap ratelimit250M matchallMatch any police 249000000 bps 7781000 limit 7781000 extended limitEarl in slot 2  13300416905062 bytes30 second offered rate 238846008 bpsaggregateforwarded 13286855706230 bytes action transmit exceeded 13561198832 bytes action dropaggregateforward 231175584 bps exceed 0 bps Earl in slot 5 43098277 bytes30 second offered rate 376 bpsaggregateforwarded 43098277 bytes action transmit exceeded 0 bytes action dropaggregateforward 488 bps exceed 0 bps Earl in slot 9 471225530 bytes30 second offered rate 3904 bpsaggregateforwarded 471225530 bytes action transmit exceeded 0 bytes action dropaggregateforward 3688 bps exceed 0 bps Classmap classdefault matchany 0 packets 0 bytes30 second offered rate 0000 bps drop rate 0000 bpsMatch any Question 1 we limit the bandwidth 250M but strange thing last night we can see the graph of our monitoring tool which shows traffic hits 300M How it could possible Question 2 What is Earl Means and we have applied the policy in module 9 so what is the link with module 2 5 Module 2 is WSX670410GE connected with MPLS Core Module 5 is the Sup engine If we want to see the drop traffic which Earl we have to look Thank you in advance RVCE As youve discovered a 7600 doesnt normally support shaping and exception would be if using a FlexWAN card 7600 is a bit weak in other QoS feature tooAssuming you want to deal with congestion better than globally policing you might consider putting a router inline between the 7600 and ISP NB another option might be to use a small switch with better QoS support The 35603750 supported port shaping with 4 egress queues so the 3560CX might too but Im unsure

tunneling using SSH port 2222,hellloi have cisco router 860 andit has two networks WAN 13266xxLAN 101010xVLAN1 10101010 also DHCP every time i want to connect to the PC on the network 101010x via SSH on Router i want to make a tunnel using port 2222 for example i am on the network 13266xx opening SSH putty and type the routers ip 10101010 or 13266xx  and then after i authenticates i want to get directly to the PC 10101084  which command i should run on the router in order to do it,Hello for the public IP address you could use a NAT statement ip nat inside source static tcp 10101084 2222 13266xx 2222 So if you connect to 13266xx on port 2222 that will connect you to 10101084 on port 2222 For the internalIP address a TCL script might work Ill check that RVCE thanks but if i connect to 10101010 on port 2222 using SSH that will connect me to 10101084 on port 2222 also  RVCE Hello no it wont I am thinking that some sort of TCL script that redirects that IP address can be written but Ill have to look into this RVCE first i want it RVCE So if i connect to my router ip 1326621073 from the network 13266xx on port 2222 using putty that will connects me automatically to 10101084 PC on port 22 because i added a nat command that you typed me  RVCE see my the show ip nat translation btw it did not worked RVCE Hello this is what your NAT statement should look like ip nat inside source static tcp 10101084 22 1326621072 2222 Do you have any access lists on your router  Post the full config if possible RVCE i did it already and it did not worked maybe i need to add access lists here

Cisco 2960  RPS LED is blinking amber,Helloafter a recovery of a main power failure the RPS LED on my Cisco 2960 is blinking amberThe command sh env power on the Switch tells me POWER is faultysh env rps says RPS is supplyingOn the RPS2300 the DC output LED is blinking greenDue to the manual this means The RPS 2300 is backing up the connected deviceSo far so true The RPS has backed up for the time the main power supply was downBut actually both the Powersupply from the RPS and the main power are availableBut the Switch didnt switch back to its bultin powersupply so still the RPS ist suppling the switchWhat can we do to get the Cisco 2960 into the correct stateIs there a special command which i can useThe command line reference wasnt very helpfulthanks in advanceMichael,MichaelThere is a button on the RPS to switch the power back to internal powersupply Please press the RPS button twice which will switch the powerfrom RPS back to internal power supply and verify the LED status If LED doesnt change the status press the button again till LED status changes to Blinking Amber A blinking Amber LED indicate that RPS is in Standby mode On 2960 you cannot do the switchover through any command Automatic backoff feature is not supported on 2960 This is a hardware limitation Automatic backoff for Catalyst 3750E and 3560E switches When the internal power supply of the connected switch resumes operation the switch sendsa backoff command to the RPS 2300 which seamlessly backs offHTHAmit Aneja RVCE Hi Amitthank you for your quick answer I already guessed that there is no way by configuring the 2960 Sorry to bother you but ive a few questions leftWhat Button on the RPS do you mean On our RPS2300 there are only two ButtonsSelect and StndbyActiveThere is no RPS ButtonIf i use the StndbyActive Button the RPS stops powering the switch and the switch immediately stops working and i loose all network connectionsIn this state i have to unplug the power cable to the bultin power supply of the switch and plug it in again Now the switch will restart using its own power supply After the switch is working again i can activate the RPS and everything is ok So it happend to me this morningSo thats the wrong way to do it What can i do to switch back to the internal power supply of the switch without loosing network connectivityMany thanks in advanceMichael RVCE Hi MichaelUnfortunately this is the only way to do it By RPS button I meant Activestandby which you guessed rightSwitching from the RPS back to the internal supply on the switch requires a reboot This is expected behavior for the 2960 as only the Eseries of 3560 and 3750 are capable of reverting without areboot or service interruption The failover is uninterrupted only while switching from the internal supply to the RPSSo what you are doing is correct there is no way you could switch back to internal power supply without rebooting the switch I remember that this was one such enhancement feature which was requested by almost everybody who was using the 2960 switch however hardware didnt support it so they fixed in 3750E  3560E series switchesHTHAmit Aneja RVCE Hi Amitthat explains everthing So weve to live with this featureTo avoid any loss of network connectivity weve put the internal powersupply directly on our UPSSo the only reason we could face this problem again is if the internal power supply fails und the RPS has to supply the switchThis closes our problemMany many thanks you for your supportMichael RVCE Hi MichaelI am glad that I could help Please mark the question as answered if you dont have any follow up questionsRegardsAmit RVCE Hi Amit I am experiencing exactly the same problem Right now the RPS is the one providing power to the switch although the internal power supply is on My question is should there be a power interruption on the RPS source would it switchover back to the internal power supply Or would it cause a reboot on the switch Regards Neil RVCE Hope that helps Redundant Power System RPS LED  Shows the RPS status If the LED is off the RPS is off or not properly connected If the LED is green the RPS is connected and ready to provide backup power If the LED is blinking green the RPS is connected but is unavailable because it is providing power to another device If the LED is amber the RPS is in standby mode or in a fault condition If the LED is blinking amber the internal power supply in the switch has failed and the RPS is providing power Recovering From a System Crash The boot loader provides access into the switch if the operating system cannot be used because of missing or damaged system files The boot loader has a commandline that provides access to the files stored in flash memory The boot loader can be accessed through a console connection following these steps Step 1 Connect a PC by console cable to the switch console port Configure terminal emulation software to connect to the switch Step 2 Unplug the switch power cord Step 3 Reconnect the power cord to the switch and within 15 seconds press and hold down the Mode button while the System LED is still flashing green Step 4 Continue pressing the Mode button until the System LED turns briefly amber and then solid green then release the Mode button Step 5 The boot loader switch prompt appears in the terminal emulation software on the PC The boot loader command line supports commands to format the flash file system reinstall the operating system software and recover from a lost or forgotten password For example the dir command can be used to view a list of files within a specified directory as shown in the figure Note Notice that in this example the IOS is located in the root of the flash folder

basically you need to make just a few adjustments controller VDSL 0 operating mode adsl2 Also the pvc pair might have to be changed on your ATM point to point subinterface If pvc 0100 doesnt work try and change it to pvc 038 What country are you in  I am just asking because a few settings could be country specific RVCE Hi Georg Many thanks for your reply I am in NZ Managed to get it sorted with the help of a Spark engineer thanks again RVCE Hello Tim just out of curiosity what changes did you make  PVC 0100 by the way is the right one for New Zealand RVCE No it was a case of shutting down the ATM dialer and setting up the internal Ethernet0 interface RVCE Hello Tim Could you please post your running config Avi

Serial tunneling,Hi allIm looking for help in configuring CISCO environment usually rookie question We have two routers  2600 series IOS 1207T  E1 connected via PRI 2CE1U interface on both sides The routers are equipped with WIC2T serial interface cards on both sides On the first site we have realtime data source RS232 syncro HDLC low speed and there is a requisite for transfering data onto the other site Since the sites are already connected via E1 we think it is not necessary to lease new line for this purpose The idea is to connect source device directly to router interface WIC2T DTEDCE and receive the data on the other side We already tried with STUN configuration but it seems it doesnt work on our router Didnt find in documentation for this protocol is it supported by this router  or IOS version  So please any help will be appreciated Thanks Solved Go to Solution,HiThis take me back a fair bitIm getting old nowIt has been quite some time since I was involved with STUN and

IPPLUS featuresetThe problem here is that you your router is lacking in memory withonly 32M Dram  8M FlashI can not find a suitable IOS that will allow you to run the STUN featurewithout upgeading both DRAM  FLASH to at leat least 48M DRAM  16M FLASHRegardsAlex Regards Alex Please rate useful posts RVCE Hi acampbellthanks for replyI was looking on official page and found that it is possible to find appropriate IOS for this amount of memory Even Enterprise feature set can be find with 832M c2600jsmz1208Where did I get wrongRegardsLeo RVCE LeoPerhaps you can post some of the details of what you found especially about what Enterprise feature set is supported with 832 MI have not gone back and looked for myself but my experience is similar to what Alex discusses  the support for STUN has been in IOS for a very long time But it is supported only in certain feature sets  and those feature sets frequently have larger requirements for flash and memoryHTHRick RVCE RichardI have no experience in configuring CISCO equipement so Ill accept all your opinions as Gods voice I found thishttpwwwciscocomenUSproductsswiosswrelps5014prodreleasenote09186a00800810a3htmland it says that it is possible to upgrade my IOS version to Enterprise with 832M Did I miss somethingAnother question I didnt find any document that says STUN is supported only on certain feature sets is that kind od hidden messageLeo RVCE LeoThank you for posting the link to the page that you are talking about It does show that there are releases of 1207T that appear to support the Enterprise feature set and that require no more than the 832 that you have So if you can find a copy of that code it may be possible to run code that does support stun on your router My guess is that the code is old enough that it will be difficult to find it I did check the software download page at Cisco and the oldest code that I find there is 122 and the versions of that code that support stun do require more than 832HTHRick RVCE Hi Alex Thanks for your config Its very interesting But unfortunately it doesnt work for me2 issues1 I cant use ip address 10110 2552552550 even when ip subnetzero command issued So I
