Routing  traffic issue,Hi Im having some traffic issue and not sure where else I can have a look as I check all routes and all looks ok to me but for some reason the traffic is not flowing as I would expect it the requirement is that the shop should be able to talk to AWS 10XX600 through MPLS network and our HO infrastructure so if shop goes to AWS recourse the traffic should look like shop  mpls  mpls ASA  core switch L3  open ASA  ecomm ASA  AWS router  AWS at the moment the traffic stop on the ecomm ASA 172112214 however if I do traceroute from the core switch the traffic will reach AWS router 10XX01 and this would be the last hop I would expect ot see as further all is blocked in terms of pings and traceroutes I have attached some drawing so its easier to illustrate and changedmask IPs for some random any assistance would be appreciated,A lot of information here Very thorough but a little tough to decipher Anyhow Im just going to give you my initial thoughts 1 I see it is a VPN from the AWS router 10xx01 to AWS Need to verify the 1050XXXX space is part of that VPNs interesting traffic 2 It looks like the routing is fine from the shop to the AWS router It is interesting the trace route from the CORE SWITCH gets the response from 10XX01 yet the others dont Not sure what to make of that 3 Keep in mind that any trace route initiated by an intermediate device will probably use its outbound interface as source So unless all the devices in the path know of that network and return route the trace will not go as far So the trace router from the AWS router will use 10XX01 as source but if the MPLS ASA after the CORE SWITCH does not have that return route the trace will end there since it cannot respond However perhaps if you leave the trace up it may start responding after a few hops Hope this is of some help RVCE Hi chrihussey thank you for the responce 1 its the BGP routing to AWS so we dont have interested traffic not like standard site to site VPN where you specify LAN and Remote range 2 this is what puzzle me as well that the core switch which is before ASAs can traceroute but ASAs cant 3 all ASA and core switch have the routes and routes for return traffic so each device have a route for the next hope for this range and next hop have a route for another next hope if this make sense so MPLS ASA for the 10XX600 have a route to go to Core switch and core switch for this network have a route for OPEN ASA and open ASA will go to ECOMM and ECOMM to AWS routerand return path is AWS route for 1050XX will go to ECOMM ASA on 10XX02 interface from ECOMM route to Open ASA 172112213 from open asa to core switch 101122254 itd now open ASA and ECOMM asa are connected with cable together and interfaces are set open asa 172112213 and ECOMM asa 172112214 they are not connected via switch so not sure if this make a difference I have configured subinterface n the ECOMM ASA as 101122240 and configured route for 1050XXXX to go via 101122240 vlan and ecomm ASA can traceroute back to the shop in this situation but I still cant reach AWS from the shop hope this make sense RVCE 1 Can you do a trace route from AWS Router to 101122249 MPLS ASA 2 Can you do a trace route from MPLS ASA to 10XX01 AWS Router 3 When you do the trace route from AWS Router to the Shop do you stop it after the first non response If so can you let it continue for some additional hops just to see if you start seeing a response RVCE when i do1 trace route from AWS Router to 101122249 MPLS ASAit will go only up to the core switch 101122254 and than I have    2 when I do do a trace route from MPLS ASA to 10XX01 AWS Routerit will go up to the ecomm ASA 172XXXX14 and than I have    3 I let it to continue but it will go for many lines as     RVCE So fundamentally everything looks correct and it is somewhat puzzling However it appears that the MPLS ASA CORE SWITCH and OPEN ASA share a common LAN segment 101122xxx If that is the case why is it necessary for the MPLS ASA to go to the CORE SWITCH and then go to the OPEN ASA to get to AWS and not go directly to the OPEN ASA and vice versa and avoid the two hops in the same subnet and possible redirects The only reason I am asking is because from the CORE switch to the shop and to AWS the trace route succeeds This would be the only instance where this would not be occurring So without this redirect it appears to work It might not be anything but just pointing it out RVCE this is how the other routes were set up so I just wanted to keep it consistent the only difference is that this is the first route going from the shop over MPLS all works from the HO over to AWS 10XX600 so I know the AWS part workseven if I skip the core switch I still cant traceroute from the open ASA to the shop and from MPLS ASA to AWS RVCE Its difficulty to say whats happening Short of the trace route anomaly things look OK Id verify the Shops network is being advertised to AWS from the AWS Router That seems to be the only unknown Other than that the next step might just be to get a packet capture Perhaps at the AWS router just to see whats happening to the packets from the shop Not sure what type router it is but if it has the remote packet capture feature it could provide some answers RVCE turns out all to be ok internally  was an issue with the return patch on the MPLS network so the ISP needed to advertise the aws router 10XX01 the traceroutes were confusing though thanks for help RVCE is there a way to delete the attachment now I changed the IPs so no big issues but just in case   RVCE Glad to hear you figured things out Dont know about deleting the attachment Not exactly sure how to do it but you could try to reach out to one of the community forum moderators Regards

NBAR2 and MS OneDrive,Does anyone have a working NBAR2 custom protocol for MS OneDrive I enabled protocol discovery and ran a sync and it is matching the sharepoint protocol within the protocol pak but I dont know what else falls into that category other than sharepoint and onedrive that I may affect I am looking to throttle OneDrive traffic I tried a DNS based custom protocol matching msedgenet packet capture showed my sync using xxxxxxbmsedgenet however this didnt work A packet capture also only shows the name resolution occurring sometimes,

iBGP loss of connectivity,Hi Id like some advice from the BGP experts amongst you on iBGP peering Our network has four iBGP peers two at each of the DC sites with a single link connecting them Lets call them rt01  rt02 at site one and rt03  rt04 at site two On the LAN side all four have connectivity between them On the WAN side all four are connected through a common eBGP relationship What Would happen to the BGP relationships if the link between the two sites went down which would leave two routers at site one and two at site two In this scenario all four routers would maintain their eBGP relationship over the WAN but we would now have iBGP relationship between rt01 and rt02 and another iBGP relationship between rt03 and rt04 both iBGP relationships using the same AS number Another question is one router is offering a default route so would this be seen by all other routers in the same AS Thanks in advance Solved Go to Solution,Yes the EBGP peering with the outside would be maintained However the problem would be that if there are common networks at both DC sites then you would probably have issues as the EBGP would see the routes from all four Optimally you would want to set it up in a way that the if LAN connectivity was lost between the two DCs then the networks specific to each DC would only be advertised in the eBGP As far as the default route is concerned it would probably be best if at least one router at each DC was had a default route In normal operation one could potentially be advertised over another and the other advertised only if the primary was lost Hope this helps RVCE Yes the EBGP peering with the outside would be maintained However the problem would be that if there are common networks at both DC sites then you would probably have issues as the EBGP would see the routes from all four Optimally you would want to set it up in a way that the if LAN connectivity was lost between the two DCs then the networks specific to each DC would only be advertised in the eBGP As far as the default route is concerned it would probably be best if at least one router at each DC was had a default route In normal operation one could potentially be advertised over another and the other advertised only if the primary was lost Hope this helps RVCE Thanks for your reply its been very helpful The actual setup is more complicated than described but I wanted to put out a scenario to see what options were available to me Following your response Ive run a few labs and can now see the consequences of various failure scenarios Thanks again
Cisco IWAN command issue  APICEM IWAN app HUB site failure,So I added a new site to my IWAN infrastructure using APICEM and my hub site turned RED I try and recover and it gives an error in APICEM that says Unable to push CLI no class browsing sequence 30 to device  I did a packet capture and found that it is running 3 commands on the router It logs into the router then it runs configure terminaldomain ONE vrf defaultmaster hubwhich brings it torouterconfigdomainvrfmcHere it runs 3 commandsno class browsing sequence 30no class softwareupdates sequence 50disable All 3 commands failSo to fix it I go into the router and add the commandsclass browsing sequence 30class softwareupdates sequence 50 And run recover site on the APICEMpacket captures shows the same 3 commandsFirst 2 no commands are successful this time but the disable command fails Same error message in apicem no class browsing sequence 30 failure Since the only command that appears to be failing is the disable command I try and create an alias for disable but I can not create an alias for configdomainvrfmc I was just going to create an alias for exit to get a successful command so it will stop complaining and move on So my question Is there a way to create the alias I need or is there a way to enable this disable command at this point in the configuration Thanks for taking the time,My goodness APICEM IWAN app is painfully stupid some times Resolution for the error was to paste the following 9 commands into the router THOUSANDS of times and hit the recover button in APICEM It went through and did a no for each of the following 9 commands 2 times and if it failed to no out a line it would fail the process So it was not enough to just have the 9 lines you had to have the 9 lines in there for both delete commands So pasting it in so fast that it could not delete them resolved the issue THEN after it deleted the 9 lines it readded each one with a bunch of configuration under each one and exited out successfully Bringing the environment back to good class email sequence 10class softwareupdates sequence 50class voiceandvideo sequence 70class browsing sequence 30class interprocessrpc sequence 60class backupandstorage sequence 90class database sequence 40class filesharing sequence 100class netadmin sequence 80class businessandproductivitytools sequence 20

MPLS site never came back online,Ok Ill try and keep this as short as possible Last week we had our MPLS service interrupted Well once services were restored all sites we have 15 sites on MPLS came back up except one First thing I did was contact ATT They were able to loop smart jack and verified all was good on their end They even sent tech out 3 different times to verify DMARC Well this store never came back up and is still down I dont know if something got hosed on config during the outage but WIC showing yellow  amber light from which I was reading indicates there is not a connection to a remote site which I assume is ATT Here is the config for that site that is down Not familiar with BGP so not sure that when I saw remote router ID was set to 0000 where other sites had a 12xxx ip assigned to it The neighbor Im assuming would be ATT Not too sure Thanks ip dhcp database flashdhcplogno ip dhcp use vrf connectedip dhcp excludedaddress 10177250 10177254ip dhcp excludedaddress

router ID was set to 0000 where other sites had a 12xxx ip assigned to it What do your logs show Did you verify that ATT still has the same BGP ASN 65015 on their end Can you ping your neighbor 128411253 Do the following clear ip bgp on that router that hasnt come up Wait a minute see if bgp came back up ping 128411253 sho ip bgp neighbors  s 128411253 show ip bgp summary show ip bgp summary  s 128411252 Thanks Matt RVCE Yes the ASN is correct but unable to hit 53 I will attempt clear ip bgp this afternoon when tech gets on site have to remote in his laptop to access router via putty and will post results RVCE Hi Can you verify if interface Serial020 is showing as upup Are you able to ping your bgp neighbor 128411253  Please run these commands and provide the output sh ip bgp summary and sh ip bgp neighbors RVCE Serial int is set to downdown and unable to bring up I replaced the WIC just to verify that wasnt the issue Now Im unable to hit 53 but for some strange reason Meraki AP is now showing up in the inventory but with not gateway to the internet I dont think it would be the actual router but Im almost out of options RVCE I would assume most likely layer 1 connectivity is the issue Wont make any sense to check anything else before layer 12 connectivity is restored between CE and PE routers RVCE I have ATT on site right now as we speak Have asked them to test connection from WIC directly to their end there is an extension from ATT original DMARC to suite Will update shortly RVCE Thats correct RVCE ATT didnt give me much info and its hard to get in contact with dispatched techs on site for whatever reason but what I am wondering about is that if other MPLS sites which all touch base back home at corp office each have a different remoterouter ID the down site needs one as well Not sure what the remoterouter would be as in if its something I would need to get from ATT or if I could use anything Still working on it RVCE Selection process for BGP router ID •Use the address configured by the bgp routerid command•Use the Loopback interface address with the highest IP address•Use the highest IP address of the interface You can manually configure your global IPV4 address to be used as BGP routerID Quite possible BGP is already using it as the BGP routerID if its the highest IP address assigned to a physical interfaces and you dont have any loopbacks configured RVCE So this is from a MPLS site thats currently up hou080rt1sh ip bgp neiBGP neighbor is 128419229 remote AS 7018 external link BGP version 4 remote router ID 12122124240 Down site has this set to 0000 this is what im confused on BGP state  Established up for 1w0d Last read 000003 last write 000052 hold time is 180 keepalive interval is 60 seconds Neighbor capabilities

Keepalives 43619 43616 Route Refresh 0 0 Total 43623 45198 Default minimum time between advertisement runs is 30 seconds RVCE Thats normal Because at one point you had eBGP peering with this neighbor and now you dont therefore its showing the routerid of a down eBGP neighbor as 0000 Once the connection comes back up remote routers routerid will be replaced by a valid routerid RVCE Ok great Thats what i was assuming but not sure I will be on site in 2 days to further troubleshoot issue
Multiple DCI load balance OTV on ASRs,Hello allI am trying to setup OTV between our two datacenters They have three connections between them from ASR to ASR I run OSPF over these links to advertise the Loopback of each ASR Then I Run BGP between the Loopbacks and all site networks are advertised via BGP Now I want to run OTV across the three links but I think this is not possible since the ASR does not support using a loopback as a join interface You can reference the attached diagram for an example of how it is setup Any suggestions,
IP SLA with Nexus 5500 series,Hi My question is based around IP SLAs with teh nexus 5548UP series of switchesI plan to use IP SLAs to track a specific path to a remote network and should the interface on the Nexus switch fails  goes down the static route to the remote network would get removed from the routing table and the floating static route would then be used and injected into the routing table untill the primamry path becomes available again at which point the routing table would be modified so it uses the original prefered path A similiar senario with the catalyst range of switches using IOS would be to setup a tracked object with reachability using icmpecho to a specific next hop with a default route to the destination network associated to the tracked objectThe topology is a pretty basic triangulated network using three nexus 5548UP switches and all the routing is done using static routes between the three switches sitesI think IP SLA reachability  interface tracking is supported in NXOS 6x which is supported on the 7K nexus platform but not on the 5K nexus paltform if anyone has implemented this or can provide a link to a guide  pdf it will be much appreciated,Hi AbdulIP SLA not yet supported on N5k Currently there is no info about further inmplementation on n5kHTHAlex RVCE It has been over a year since this last post Has there been any change on the n5k to incorporate Reliable Static Routing using IP SLA RVCE N5KN6K supports object tracking but as of NXOS 71 you still cant tie it into static routes and theres no IP SLA However NXOS 602N21 did add EEM which can periodically run a python script that does what you want Attached is RouteTrackpy Place it in bootflash run it manually from the CLI to test it out and then create an EEM applet to run it every few seconds Usage RouteTrackpy route routenexthop routevrf pinghost pingvrf debug The simplest form is RouteTrackpy 1921683024 10001 This will add or remove the config command ip route 1921683024 10001 based on whether or not 10001 is pingable The script produces syslog messages like these 2013 Oct 16 192212 DC2N5K2 USER3SYSTEMMSG Removing route vrf management 10008 to 17231511 ping 10891695 failed  RouteTrackpy 2013 Oct 16 192231 DC2N5K2 USER3SYSTEMMSG Adding route vrf management 10008 to 17231511 ping 10891695 success  RouteTrackpy RVCE Craig Do I have to modify the Python script in anyway before uploading it to flash I dont see any reference to an IP address in the routetrackpy file Also can you help with the syntax of the EEM script itselfFrom what I gather it will

19216811 debug into the CLI The debug switch provides more detail on whats being done Unfortunately NXOS 70 and 71 both have open bug CSCuj69824 Python script is not working when called using the python scriptname command You can help get this bug fixed by opening a TAC case But until that bug is fixed python youll need to use one of the NXOS 60 releases RVCE I have found that once the script is in the correct directory you can run it using the command source RouteTrackpy The problem I have though is that the modules seem to be different in 7xOnce I figured out the correct directory for the script and the new syntax to run it I started to get the followingsource RouteTrackpy 1060016 10812Traceback most recent call last File bootflashscriptsRouteTrackpy line 122 in module routecli

5 routes What would I need to do to get this to work Do I need to load these to both 5K or just on one This would be on a pair of 5k and 3k running the following code 5K1 and 5K2 with HSRP  602N24all routes are staticCore at data center 15 routes 3K1 and 3K2 with HSRP  602A11dall routes are staticCore ate data center 22 routes RVCE A Nexus VPC pair requires that all Layer3 be perfectly in sync so youd need to run the script on both switches Routetrack can only addremove one route You could run the script five times or use a dummy recursive next hop see 10999999 below Im going to assume that N5K1 has the primary link to N3K1 carrying vlan 100 and N5K2 has the backup link to N3K2 carrying vlan 101 Vlans 101  102 are trunked across all four switches using a nonVPC trunk within each DC since you shouldnt put those on the VPC peer link this may not describe your environment but hopefully you can adapt Here is a sample config N5k 1  2 int vlan 100 description primary link to DC 2 via N5K 1

ARP not getting Updated automatically,Hi AllWe are facing issue with arpARP is not getting updated on one of the internet routerScenarioWe have 2 firewalls in cluster connected to 2 Internet routers When doing FW fail over arp in not getting updated on primary internet router however no issues with secondary routerTopology Firewall connected to L2 Switch 3750  from switch internet routers are connectedPlease advisesuggest what can checked in this case,Wouldnt traffic change direction when doing failover Therefore routing tablesarp entries would only populate on the active router and not the standby router Thanks Matt RVCE our active router is primary one on which arp is nt getting updated  whn arp is not getting updated bgp neigborship is going down  traffic is divertng to secondary RVCE Hello which routers do you have and which IOS  RVCE cisco 3945 not sure of ios both have same ios RVCE Hello without having seen your configs check if you might be hitting the bug below Box to Box NAT  GARP not sent by the Primary Router after taking the Active roleCSCvf21090DescriptionSymptomThe NAT failover works fine and the Secondary NAT box takes up active role when the Primary NAT box crashesreloads however the failback does not work as expectedWhen the Active router comes back up it performs BULKSYNC and moves to Active role however does not generates any GARP to update the mac address on the connected device thus even though the Primary router is Active the ARP for the NATTED ip still points to the Standby Routers mac address on the host devices ConditionsBox to Box NAT

cisco 2911 no internet behind router,Hello good morning i have problems to get access to the internet behind an 2911 Config should be as followsinternet is provided by an external dhcp server signal comes through ge 010 The 2911 should be standard gateway and dhcp server for the connected clients on ge 00 will be a switch later ge 020 should be backup for ge 010 and cellular 000 should be backup for ge 020 But at the moment i am not able to get internett on a connected client at ge00 I figured out the following2911 dhcp server is giving ip addresses through ge 00 as it should be  nw 1001300 excluded 100130130 so i get the first ip 10013031 at a connected client 2911 gets an ip from external dhcp on ge 000 ping is working via console on the 2911 8888ping is also translating adresses via console wwwgooglecom wwwcicsocom on a connected client at ge 00 i can ping the cisco2911 static ip 100130254but i can not ping anything from the internet Network connection shows no internet at

1 router and 2 ISP connections  BGP,Hi I am doing a LAB exercise and i need some answeres  i have my own public address that i would like to advertise out Scenario 1 If i have 1 router but pairing with 2 ISPs and want it to activepassive how do i achieve this can i use local preference and asprepend can you please post just the main lines of config is this possible to do with just 1 router where both ISPs terminate Scenario2 If ISP is doing the failover what would my config look like,Hi Yes localpreference and ASprepends should work For your scenario weight Cisco router would work in lieu of or in addition to localpreference I think you will have more luck with responses if you post what you think the configs should be and people can correct that if need be Also please clarify if ISP is doing failover question RVCE If you are looking for symmetric routing then I would use both local preference and AS prepend so I can control both outbound and inbound traffic and force it use the same ISP for both inbound and outbound traffic Since you both ISP links will terminate on 1 router then you should be fine because failover will happen on its own if one directly connected interface to the ISP go down For more protection you can use IP sla to monitor outside reachability in a situation where directly connected interface is up but ISP itself is having issues and not routing packets to the internet

bgp bgp neighborshio network command,Hi AllCan someone help me to understand BGPs behavior hereI have 2 HQs named Slough  Heathrow and multiple sites Eg Bracknell hereI have BGP running between CEPE My concern here is that if I try to reach Slough subnets from Bracknell mentioned in Diagram they are routed via HeathrowRequest everybodys input here to understand this better Do let me know if required more information Attached is the diagram for your reference,Your MPLS may be ordered as a Hub  Spoke topology HTH RVCE That diagram doesnt really help This isnt going to sound like a very helpful reply but you really need to speak with your managed MPLS service provider in the first instance In the absence of any information to the contrary it will be their PE router that is providing the incorrect default route to the Bracknell CE router and not necessarily something you are able to change without their assistance
Hub and spoke,Hi thereThanks for readingIs there an algorithm or methodology for rightsizing the circuit speed at the HQ Hub I cant allow the remote sites to overflow the Hub but also dont want to throttle the spoke sites Its a balance Im searching for between circuit speeds at the hub and at the spoke Ive got 100Mbps at the Hub and plan to install 20 sites with 20Mbps to 50MbpsThanksBob,Im not aware of any algorithm but the methodology would be to make a determination as to the type of and amount of traffic from each site For example will there be large file transfers backups imaging and at what times of day That and taking into account email web traffic voice etc Not necessarily an easy task and it may just come down to best guess You also need to identify the traffic flows If all traffic is going to be from hubs to the spoke thats one thing However if there will be traffic from hub to hub that essentially doubles the bandwidth at the hub as it will have to receive from the source and then send it back out to the destination on the same interface My opinion is that if you are going to have 20 sites ranging from 20  50 Mbps youll need a bigger hub circuit Even if all sites were 20 Mbps that would be an aggregate of 400 Mbps So if all 20 were at 12 utilization youll still be at 200Mbps at the hub Not sure what type circuit your getting but if you could get a rate limited Gig connection at the HUB you could then find out the costs for different rates and it may be easier to adjust to higher rates as utilization dictates Hope this helps RVCE Is there an algorithm or methodology for rightsizing the circuit speed at the HQ HubNot that Im aware of Much depends on your traffic volumes and SLA requirementsI cant allow the remote sites to overflow the Hub but also dont want to throttle the spoke sitesTo avoid any overflow the hub would require its bandwidth to be the aggregate of all your spoke bandwidths

Multiple ISP WAN Load Balancing,Hi allI have a Cisco 3850 as my core switch with IP base license Above that Cisco 1921 router is there where one of my ISP terminated I am going to add another ISP to my network Now I have to do LOAD BALANCING between WAN Link I do not have Load Balancer in my setup My requirement1 Is it possible to do WAN Link Load Balancing in 3850 using GLBP and PBR2 Will GLBP support in Cisco 3850 with IP base license or IP service License3 Is there any other alternate ways to achieve WAN load Balancing Both the ISPs are different Multiple VLANs are there in the network Cisco 1921 has only one WAN link The other new ISP have an ordinary home modem bleep router,Hello you need to run Cisco IOS XE Denali 16xx on your 3850 to have access to GLBP That said you could also simply use two static default routeseg ip route 0000 0000 GigbabitEthernet00 name ToISP1 ip route 0000 0000 GigbabitEthernet01 name ToISP2 RVCE 3 on 1921 might support PfR For it to dynamically load balance though as your other router is not another ISR it would need to have primary path egress link to other router For redundancy if the other router supported dual ingress you could have a backup path from the 3850 Unfortunately this makes for a rather messy setup
Ip nat outside on 2 interfaces,Hello everyone very new to the community  my last post was marked as spam  because I think I tried to update it too soon with pictures sorry about that As you can see in my example bellow I have on R0 configured a NAT insideoutside as per my print screen with the CLI  Everything works fine but I want to implement the same methodology on R2 in the left corner but every time I set nat outside on Gig 0  1 ping fails from left to right same happens vice versa  and I do not understand whats wrong  I guess I cannot configure it this way Can someone help maybe explaining why and point me to a source of information  Really sorry  I hope this doesnt get marked as spam also TYBR,

How to access another VLAN via my gateway to gateway connection,just wondering if anyone wiser than me can help I have setup my gateway to gateway connection ok and I can access each side Office 19216810Remote 19216820 in the office I have now created two more VLAN networks on the RV320192168100192168200I am trying to set it up so that the remote site can access all the networks more for Remote Desktop to the servers i can see in the Gw to Gw setup the RV320 asks for a subnet of each site and I can’t seem to add the new networks to this section I have also read about using the Advanced Routing option The VLAN are created and have enable inter VLAN access When I am in the office I can access all the networks but not over the GW to GW connection Can anyone help,Hi there With any VPN setup you will typically require an ACL which is used to identify interesting traffic the encryption domain destined for the remote end which will be sent via the VPN Looking at the RV320 configure guides it would appear that you can only define a single subnet in this ACL The issue you have is the 19216820 subnet lies between 19216810 and 192168100 and 192168200 Due to this limitation you need to ensure each site is allocated a contiguous address block this would be good practice TBH eg Office  1921680020  19216800  19216815254 Remote 19216816020  192168160  19216831254 Obviously this will require to resubnet both sites Alternatively just configure static routes on the remote site RV320 with the nexthop address set as SVI IP for 19216810 subnet cheers Seb

Policy Based Routing Based on Source and Destination IP,I have a question about policy based routing To preface my question I want to give a small overview of our setupWe have a campus spread over a 5 mile area where we have 5 sites Site A B C D and E Site A is our main data center We have two internet egress points out of Site A Provider 1 and Provider 2 The other four sites connect back to site A over fiber using L3 addressing for the links Each site has its own 20 broken down to multiple VLANs Their default routes point back to our Site A What Id like to do is point a specific VLANlets say VLAN 100 for each site to only go out through Provider 2 while all other VLANs go out through Provider 1 circuit I understand how to build the PBR but my question is where do I apply the PBR Would it be on each L3 link at the core switch where all the L3 fiber terminates at Site A Thanks in advance for your help Solved Go to Solution,The PBR needs to be applied at the place where the egress is happening towards the two providers because you have to set the next hop Only the egress device has access to the next hops Can the egress device see the original subnet addressing or tell the subnets apart If the egress device is after firewalls so that the source is hidden then you may need to configure the firewalls to NAT those subnets into a magic unique IP address that PBR can then match on It may also be possible to QoS mark the traffic and then use PBR to match the QoS markings RVCE The PBR needs to be applied at the place where the egress is happening towards the two providers because you have to set the next hop Only the egress device has access to the next hops Can the egress device see the original subnet addressing or tell the subnets apart If the egress device is after firewalls so that the source is hidden then you may need to configure the firewalls to NAT those subnets into a magic unique IP address that PBR can then match on It may also be possible to QoS mark the traffic and then use PBR to match the QoS markings RVCE Can the PBR be applied based on source and destination pair ACL say for example users on the network 101010024 are trying to access 8888 then can they be directed to specific ISP based on PBR Thanks Dheeraj

Panning to connect my customer to two different SPVPLS,Hey guys I am planning to connect a new customer that will have two branch and 1 Central site to two different SP We contracted two VPLS So I am wondering whether I can do this design without any issue please see attachment for details I know I can also run a routing protocol over the VPLS as OSPF however we want do do things easy and secure Do you think this scenario accomplish these thingsPlease correct me if I am wrong Thanks,have you only got 1 router on your central site or 2 if you have 2 run BGP across vpls using local preference or even simpler a default route to your central site with different admin distance and track your primary default route to let it fail over to the one with higher admin distance Please remember to rate useful posts by clicking on the stars below
Adding a second wan router to the same ISP  BGP AS,Hello I have attached a drawing of our current design and our potential future designWe are looking to make redundant wan routers with the help of our ISP so that we dont have a single point of failure anymore As you can see were going to add a 2nd wan router and configure iBGP between them No loadbalancing will happen just a pure primaryactive configuration Our ISP said that we would need to use local pref on BGP to advertise all our prefixes to them so that when CE1 fails CE2 with local pref of 90 will begin to become the primary bgp router Now my question is this So I get how the failover happens to the ISP but what about the inside knowing the default way out I dont believe iBGP will help all the networks inbehind the core find a way out to the internet without something like HSRP right If CE1 was to fail how will all the networks in the inside of our network know which way to take As you can see the links in brown are routed EIGRP links that connect the core to the WAN routerwill that do the internal failover trick for us i guess the main problem is whether CE1 fails or the link to the ISP fails will result in different outcomes so its tough to decide how to configure this Thank you in advance Solved Go to Solution,Thanks for the clarification that this is for MPLS connectivity to your branches and that you have a separate router and ISP for Internet connectivity So in your network the default route needs to point to the Internet router and ISP So in the routers we are discussing the MPLS ISP would not be advertising a default route and would need to advertise the networkssubnets from all the branch offices HTH Rick RVCE in very general term both your CEs have access to the internet through btheir respective PEs so both your CEs have a default route to their respective PE If you are using EIGRP then both CEs can inject a default route into EIGRP where one CE is more preferred over the other so you will need to tweak the metrics this way you dont need HSRP what are you using between CE and PE is it BGP or just a static default route on the CE pointing to your PE Please remember to rate useful posts by clicking on the stars below RVCE we are using BGP between CE and PE In our current design we have a BGP neighborship with the PE then in our future design our CE2 will also have a BGP neighborship with a different ISP router but same AS Ok so EIGRP will do the trick for us internallyso if CE1 dies CE2 will be used as the default route out to the BGP RVCE Yes if you run EBGP on both of your routers to receive advertisements from the ISP and run IBGP between your routers then you can use local preference on the routers to establish which one is preferred in BGP and it would be the one to forward traffic to the ISP If the primary router fails or if its BGP session to its ISP fails then the secondary router would begin to be used to forward traffic to the ISP Both of your routers would learn a default route from its BGP peer and you can redistribute that default route into EIGRP By manipulating the metric used in the redistribution you can make one of the default routes more attractive and if that router goes down or if its default route from the ISP is withdrawn then its default route in EIGRP will be withdrawn That is how the devices inside your network will know to which router they should forward traffic for the Internet Note that this addresses how to have primary and backup for traffic going from your network to the Internet It does not address how the ISP will forward traffic to your network You need to work something out with the ISP so that they will have the primary and backup relationship That might use prepending or might use MED or might use communities or the ISP might suggest some other mechanism This is something to discuss with the ISP It is not an important factor in how to establish primary and backup but I wonder what your ISP is advertising to your routers Is it default only Is it default with selected other routes Or is I default plus full Internet routing table In your situation all you really need is the default route HTH Rick RVCE Thats a good question Richard This is an MPLS BGP router that we use strictly to connect to all our remote branches This is not used for example our internet access here at the office We have a separate router and circuit for that How would I find out the answer to your last set of questions RVCE Thanks for the clarification that this is for MPLS connectivity to your branches and that you have a separate router and ISP for Internet connectivity So in your network the default route needs to point to the Internet router and ISP So in the routers we are discussing the MPLS ISP would not be advertising a default route and would need to advertise the networkssubnets from all the branch offices HTH Rick RVCE Good Evening Richards explanation is very comprehensive I just wanted to add that when redistribution of bgp prefixs is done into eigrp whether it is a default route or set of networkssubnets that you are receiving from the ebgp ISP routers just keep in mind that metric manipulation is set in a manner that if the primary CE router loses connectivity to its ebgp neighbor than the secondary CE router is preferred by your internal routers to forward traffic because primary CE router is still receiving routes from its ibgp neighbor which is your secondary CE router and if eigrp metric is not properly configured then its quite possible that primary CE router continues to be preferred over secondary CE router even after losing bgp peering with ISP router Now this is not a show stopper packets will continue to be forwarded but you will have one extra hop RVCE Thank you for this information RVCE Hey Cofee Thanks for writing that last statement Im actually trying to configure that part of right now but Im having troubles Would it be something like this

httpssupportforumsciscocomt5wanroutingandswitchingeigrpinternalroutestowanmplsbgproutermp3379592M295626 Thank you for your help RVCE I will try to lab it tonight and get back to you I have seen your other post RVCE Thank you sir Please ask me more questions if you need I have a tendency of confusing people Here is the link for how I perform the failover on our 2 routers for BGP httpwwwcenturylinkcombusinesshelpnetworkconfiguringyourcenturylinkmplscircuitsforfailoverhtml RVCE Hey Richard To address your question about the inbound from the ISP this is what I read in their document  By sending a community via the external BGP session eBGP the CE router is signaling to the PE router to modify the LP Note Local preference isn’t advertised between two eBGP peers LP is a nontransitive attribute meaning it won’t be advertised outside of an autonomous system AS In our ISP network route maps are built on every PE provider edge to modify LP when certain BGP communities are sent by the CE customer edge The local preference value is used by BGP to determine the best path The largest local preference wins the tiebreaker  Im not sure if Im understanding this correctly but it seems that since Ill be using communities to send the LP values to the PE it seems that they will automatically be able to do the routing on their end back to accommodate the redundant paths RVCE Yes The use of communities is one alternative that I mentioned It is good to know that your ISP has worked out a solution using communities By having your primary router send the community that tells the ISP to set a more attractive LP and having your backup router send the community that tells the ISP to set a less attractive LP then the ISP will easily accomplish the routing to implement the primary backup relationship in routing traffic to you And it will automatically respond in the correct way if there is some issue with your primary router I believe that this is the optimum solution HTH Rick
Dynamic GRE Tunnel Setup,Hello I have a question on dynamic GRE Tunnel Setup that I hope someone can help The issue is in my tunnel setup I need the local tunnels destination on R1 to be whatever IP address that the remote tunnels source on R4 acquires from its IP DHCP assignment Refer to the diagram belowWhen I configure R1s tunnel destination to be the known IP address assigned to the e01 of R4 I can ping R4 Loopback IP address as well as the remote Tunnels IP address without any issue My question is if the remote tunnels source on R4 acquires its IP address from DHCP is there a way to configure the local tunnels destination to be that DHCP IP address without knowing it in advanceBelow are the routers configurations along with the outputs of show commands R1hostname R1interface

MTU restriction in L2 Cloud affecting ISIS,Hi We need to configure 6 devices in a network 28 to see each other in ISIS 4 of them have IOS and 2 of them have IOS XR The interfaces are subinterfaces of a bundle And there is a restriction from the Vendor giving us Layer 2 connectivity that MTU size must be 9000 no higher However in the Bundle interface of all the 6 devices we have the MTU set to 9216 There are other subintefaces not in ISIS on that Interface that are configured to form BGP peering to get GRE tunnels formed above them At this moment this is what we have configuredXRROUTERinterface

would give us 9000 for both CLNS and IPv4 IOS MTU 9003  This by default would give an IP mtu of 9003 and 9000 for CLNS You can also set IP mtu for 9000 and manually set the clns MTU if you want To understand better the log messages a debug or packet capture would be the best way to move on RVCE Ok I will need a window to do the tests and debugs There is another link with issues which is also running ISIS so it might be disturbing the troubleshooting I will post the results when I can do the tests Thank you very much for your help and time RVCE Hello Maria You are very welcome Please let me know the results RVCE Hello Maria how are you doing Do you can do this test Because Im with the same problem here Thks RVCE Hi there just today I was able to do the tests The Duplicated ID message disappeared as soon the provider shut down one of the interfaces going to their devices which was part of our bundle We have two interfaces in a bundle in the same devices XR going to two different Juniper devices at the providers end So this mean there was a loop at the provider ends And today with that link down still I added clns mtu 8982 to the subinterface po102085 in the IOS devices and the ISIS neighbors came up So we have mtu 9000 in XR Bundle interface and clsn mtu 8982 in the IOS subinterface And ISIS is up Hope this works for you as well
Telnet and SSH stopped working after configuring static NAT on router,Hi everyoneI am having weird problem with my edge routers Everything was working perfectly before I configured NAT forwarding but stopped allowing incoming telnet and ssh sessions from the internet the second it was implemented  I have added an accesslist allowing telnet and ssh to the interface facing the internet but no go  I turned on debug and tried telnetting to the router but for some reason the router is still not allowing the session even though an accesslist is allowing telnet and ssh so therefore debug is not reporting anything being initiated  Anyone experienced a simailar problem like that before ,Hidid you NAT forward the telnet and ssh traffic leaving the external port as default  in which case can you modify your static PAT using another port as external port and tell us if it works afterRegardsAlainDont forget to rate helpful posts Dont forget to rate helpful posts RVCE Hi AlainThank you for the reply Before posting my question I did try doing a NAT forward to the inside interface using port 1022 and 1023 on the WAN interface outside forwarding to port 22 and 23 on the LAN interface inside I evenned try to forward it to a loopback interface as well but no joy Thats why I decided to write the ACLs  Again this is a weird one RVCE Hicould you post your sanitized config RegardsAlainDont forget to rate helpful posts Dont forget to rate helpful posts RVCE I agree with Alain that it would help if we could see the config In particular I am interested in how the address translation was set up and whether it uses an extended access list that permits something to any I have seen situations where telnet and SSH access was impacted when address translation used an ACL that included the any parameter in the permit statementHTHRick RVCE Ok guysBelow is the config but I had to change the ip addresses for security purposes but this should still give you an idea on how the router is

you are using for address translationaccesslist 110 permit ip 1100 00255255 anyI suggest that you change it and make it a standard access list perhaps accesslist 10 permit 1000 00255255and then change both route maps cbeyond and charter to match ip address 10Give it a try and let us know if it makes any differenceHTHRick RVCE I tried changing the accesslist and update the routemap as suggested but still no go  I am still unable to telnet or ssh to the device  RVCE In taking another look at the config I notice that your access list telnetaccess is permitting only 3 hosts of which 2 appear to be inside and 1 appears to be outside I wonder if this is part of your issue As a way to investigate I suggest that you add a line to the access list so that it would look like thisp accesslist standard telnetaccess permit 1115 permit 11130 permit 216710092deny any logI would also ask whether the problem is affecting telnet and ssh from sources inside the network or outside of the network or bothAnd a copy of the updated config might be helpfulHTHRick RVCE Correct me if I am wrong the explicit deny in the accesslist will deny anything else that do not match those 3 hosts in the telnetaccess list therefore adding deny any log will not make a difference  Those 3 hosts are the only one by design that should be able to access the router  They worked before without any problems but stopped working the second I configured the NAT forwarding statements RVCE Yes if those 3 hosts are intentionally the only hosts allowed telent or SSH access then adding the deny statement in the ACL would have no effect other than to demonstrate if someone else did attempt accessDoes it make any difference in the problem whether the telnetSSH request comes from inside the network or outside Does it make any difference in the problem if the telnetSSH request is to an outside facing interface or the inside facing interfaceHTHRick RVCE Yes it does  I only want to allow telnet and ssh access to two workstations on the local network and to my remote home office just in case I have to access the router remotely backdoor in case of the firewalls behind those routers fail without having to use VPN The accessclass statement under the line vty should allow access either way Thats why I said it was a weird problem RVCE Hi Was this ever resolved We often have situations where routemaps are requires on 11 NAT translations to forward a range of specific ports to a certain local IP address Please see below for an example of our configuration IP addresses have been masked for security purposes ip nat inside source static 1001 2221 route RTP extaccesslist 131 permit udp host 1001 any range 10020 10532routemap RTP permit 10 match ip address 131 In all instances where this is used were unable to access the routers via telnet or SSH using the public interface 2221 as soon as the routemap is applied ThanksShaun RVCE Weve found a work around creating specific NAT translations to an internal interface for the ports which need to be externally accessible on the Cisco before we create the 11 NAT using a routemap resolves the issue RVCE Hicould you try with this local PBR disabled like this

Is the use of linklocal address required for IPv6 static routing next hop,The RFC for Neighbor Discovery RFC4861 in section 8 statesA router MUST be able to determine the linklocal address for each of its neighboring routers in order to ensure that the target address in a Redirect message identifies the neighbor router by its linklocal address For static routing this requirement implies that the next hop routers address should be specified using the linklocal address of the router For dynamic routing this requirement implies that all IPv6 routing protocols must somehow exchange the linklocal addresses of neighboring routers Yet all documentation I encountered including Cisco and Juniper always use a Global Unicast Address or a Local Unicast Address as next hop for IPv6 static routing  is the use of linklocal address mandatory as IPv6 static routing next hop is the use of linklocal address a best practice as IPv6 static routing next hop Thanks for any clarification ,You can use either a global or link local address as the next hop for a static route If you use a link local address you will need to also configure the interface as the same link local address might exist on several interface I would also recommend to explicitly configure the link local address if you use it as the next hop for your static route This way you will not run in any issue if you change the hardware which will change the MAC address which will change the link local address as the link local address is generated via EUI64 by default Regards Harold RitterSr Technical LeaderCCIE 4168 RS SPharoldciscocomMéxico móvil 52 1 55 8312 4915Cisco MéxicoPaseo de la Reforma 222Piso 19Cuauhtémoc JuárezCiudad de México 06600México

SIP differ with ISP carriers like big 3,In a meeting recently and the question was asked how do we provide a SIP trunk to your existing avaya session manager PBX box well not sure because how does each carrier handle sip trunking is there a standard around for SIP or something that goes hand in hand the person was very hung on what kind of configuration do we we use for SIP like 61 or 62 Solved Go to Solution,short answer NO there is no standard in the implemenation of SIP or how SIP providers implement is SIP itself has standards yes I have worked on a number of SIP trunks between cisco equipment and Avaya Compatibility is good sometimes thru udpo sometimes tcp so really how long is a piece of string Please remember to rate useful posts by clicking on the stars below RVCE short answer NO there is no standard in the implemenation of SIP or how SIP providers implement is SIP itself has standards yes I have worked on a number of SIP trunks between cisco equipment and Avaya Compatibility is good sometimes thru udpo sometimes tcp so really how long is a piece of string Please remember to rate useful posts by clicking on the stars below

iBGP with same AS number,Is it a good idea to configure iBGP for remote sites in the same AS numberNow we have ospf with flexvpn for these remote sites and we are trying to get rid of it and configure BGP isp1 isp2   eBGP  eBGP   R1 ibgpR2     r1r2    remote site1 remsite2 On r12 we have the flexvpn Is it a good idea to configure iBGP for that branches or it will be a hard work to maintain the network after Thanks,It depends on what you want to solve or are trying to achieve Now I have never worked with FlexVPN so my opinion is based on experiences using BGP only for things like this iBGP is easier to scale when routereflectors are in place however if you dont have those it may be a big problem since youd need a fullmesh or very carefully planned partialmesh depending on routing patterns if can be a problem too if you dont plan well where theyll be located BGP in general is a really powerful protocol if you want to add constraints into your network policies per site its also less resource heavy on CPU due to not having to calculate periodic updates this is only if were not talking about internet size routing tables If you dont want to use routereflectors or consider the possibility bad for your scenario Id go with eBGP using private ASNs RVCE Thank you for your reply on thisThey are just trying to find a solution to migrate the network to a more modern one where the branch offices are connected through BGP and not through an IGPthe existing network is very stablefor the eBGP scenario with private ASHQAS64512ISP1ISP2BRAS65500would the ISPs badly influence the BGP path if they are removing our private ASISP1 neighbor ISP2 removeprivateasThanks RVCE Assuming youre using tunnels GRE IPIP IPSEC VTI etc The ISPs wont influence this you wont peer with them this would be only internal and this is what I assumed when I replied to you Basically you create tunnels towards HQ and then peer over those tunnels Now your last graph shows something different is your intention to peer with each ISP directly on each branch and propagate each branchs public addressing via the internet as in no tunnelingvpn technology Namely Branch1 has IP space 100024 HQ has IP space 101024 You want to broadcast those prefixes directly to the internet If this is the case first as you pointed your ISPs will remove the privateas assuming you use privateas second assuming each branchhq address space is unique no issues should arise aside from the fact that youll have your internal address space spread all over different AS You may use iBGP but this would collide with BGP antiloop prevention mechanisms and as such for it to work you need to 1 Make sure the ISP propagates routes to HQ and from HQ to branch even though they have HQs AS inside of it2 Make sure each edge HQ Branches etc override the loop mechanism using allow asin Now you say the branches are connected via an IGP and also mentioned flexwan so I am not sure this last part applies to you please clarify Will you build tunnels VPNs or want to broadcast per branchhq address space directly to the internet
3650 LAN base and 8021q,HiA quick question does the 8021q VLAN trunking functionality exist in the LAN base image of the 3650 or do I need IP base If anyone can also point me to an actual reference for this info that would be greatThanks Michael,The 3560 LAN base image supports 8021Q trunking I dont have any running LAN base but I do have some 2960s running LAN base and they are trunking Admittedly I cant find anything explicitly saying it does but it does spell out what additional features the IP Base and IP Services images provide The Cisco Catalyst 3560 Series can be purchased with the IP Base or IP Services licenses preinstalled The IP Base license offers advanced QoS rate limiting ACLs and basic static and Routing Information Protocol RIP routing functions The IP Services license provides a richer set of enterpriseclass features including advanced hardwarebased IPv6 unicast and IPv6 Multicast routing as well as policybased routing PBR The IP Services license upgrades Cisco Catalyst 3560 Series switches to include IPv6 routing support Upgrade licenses are available to upgrade a switch from the IP Base license to the IP Services license httpswwwciscocomcenusproductscollateralswitchescatalyst3560seriesswitchesproductdatasheet09186a00801f3d7dhtml Regards Regards RVCE Thanks I was mixing up trunking and tunnelling Trunking is supported in the LAN Base 8021q tunnelling only in the IP Base RVCE 8021q is the only encapsulation supported and it doesnt matter if its LAN Base LAN Lite etc Ciscos ISL is no longer being supported

Bundling odd number of ports on etherchannel,I know its not the best practice I have an ASR100x and Im thinking of If i should bundle 2 or 3 cables The router has 6 ports I need to split the 6 in half leaving me with an option of either 2 per bundle or 3 Suggestions Should I just stick with the recommend even numbers only,Hi The portchannel is using hashing to decide wich interface to send traffic If you are using 2 interface it will be like this  i will show the hashing result as 0 and 1 interface 1 will have hashing 0  half of the traffic interface 2 will have hashing 1  half of the traffic with 3 interfaces the hashing will be 00  01  10 and 11 This will result in interface 1 will have hashing 00 and 11  half of the traffic interface 2 will have hashing 01  a quarter of the traffic interface 3 will have hashing 10  a quarter of the traffic interface 4 that is not existing hashing 11 will be on interface 1 instead So I would personally use 2 interfaces and not 3 This is not an exact mathematic because the flows that is ditributed hashed is not calculated on how much traffic they are generated its just the hashing that decide and hashing can be configured for sourcemac destmac sourceipdestipsourceportdestport in some combinations Mikael RVCE Its not just even numbers optimal hashing distribution is usually achieved on a power of 2 number of links So if youre looking to get the best usage of your ports you wouldnt want to use 3 linksHowever as you have the extra port using it isnt going to degrade anything and it would add to your aggregate bandwidth So sure use it if you wantBTW on some later platforms eg sup2T ASR 1K hashing uses a larger divisor so youll get a better load distribution including across 3 links RVCE thank you all

887VA Bridge Mode  VDSL2  BT Infinity Connection,Good afternoon I have a Cisco 887VA which Im trying to configure as a modem only Ive been following a few threads on here regarding the VDSL config for bridged mode which seems to be what Im after The modem side of the router seems to be working correctly as when I type sh controller vdsl 0 I get the following output which Ive cropped down a littleHowever the router Draytek 3900 which I have connected to the 887VA is failing its PPoE connection with an error Message  PPPoE  No response from server side  I have also tried using a Windows PPoE connection and it fails with Error 651Im suspicious that my interface config on the Ethernet is incorrect Im new with Cisco devices so its entirely possible Ive done something stupid The BT infinity instructions for VDSL are just to use a VLAN tag of 101 at the modem so Ive attempted to modify other bridged configs on this forum to do exactly that Here is my current router configI have tried using both Ethernet port 0 and port 1 to connect to the WAN port on my Dratytek and also with my PPoE connection on the PC but both behave the same and fail to connect Thanks for reading hopefully someone can spot the error of my ways,Just an update Fixed the issue by changing the Ethernet0 config Will post the full working config when I get chance

Switching over between BGP and OSPF,HelloI have a question that I hope someone would be able to help Basically I have a router D1 that has two links to two different remote routers CoreRT and NRR1 D1 runs OSPF with CoreRT while D1 runs EBGP with NRR1 When I ping a host MMS on another router Node1 that connects to CoreRT OSPF will be the used as the preferred routing protocol because D1 learns that host via OSPF routing process When I shutdown the OSPF link between D1 and the CoreRT the link switches to use BGP between D1 and NRR1 as expected because it is the only path available It takes about 20 to 24 pings dropped before D1 can detect that the OSPF path is no longer available before switching over to BGPWhen I bring back the OSPF link the ping continues to traverse the BGP link to reach to the host unless I either 1 perform a clear ip bgp  on D1 or 2 perform a shutdown on the link that connects between D1 and NRR1 to force the traffic originated from D1 to use OSPFMy question is is there a way to configure D1s BGP routing process to trigger the switchover from BGP to OSPF sooner instead of performing either one of the actions aboveBelow are the configuration files for D1 CoreRT and NRR1 along with the topology Thank you in advancehostname DUCE1RR1interface Loopback0description D1  Router Loopback IP Addressip address 11111111 255255255255ip ospf 100 area 0interface

bgp it works with both Below is the link for BFD configuration with BGP httpswwwciscocomcenustddocsiosxmliosiproutebgpconfigurationxe16irgxe16bookbgpsupportforbfdhtml RVCE Hello cofee Thanks for your reply I have enabled OSPF bfd on the interfaces between D1 and the CoreRT and BGP bfd on the interfaces between D1 and NRR1 and noted that I still have to perform the clear ip bgp  command in order to force the traffic to switch over to the OSPF link when the OSPF link came back up after a simulated link failure Thanks again RVCE I think the default values used by BFD is quite fast and it shouldnt take that long to failover from one protocol to another but did you try tweaking the default BFD parameters to make convergence more faster Its also possible that it has nothing to do with slow convergence and may be there is some dependencyconflict between the routing protocols you are using but hard to tell without labbing it I havent had a chance to lab your topology and its quite large RVCE Thanks coffee I am thinking of writing EEM scripts to make the router D1 to switch to OSPF link as soon as it comes back online The challenge is I have no experience in writing EEM RVCE Hi It appears to be an issue with the Ethernet module used in GNS3 I have discovered that even after shutting down the directly connected Ethernet interface on the remote router the neighboring router was still showing interface to be upup which shouldnt happen and protocol should be down Because of this it BGP takes too long to detect the connection failure but on a real device this wont happen as link failure detection will happen pretty fast OSPF experiences the same fate but slightly faster in convergence because the dead timer on broadcast interfaces is 40 seconds You shouldnt have this problem if you use serial interfaces in gns3 If you want test my theory then telnet into D1 either from corert or nrr1 and ping host mms with a continuous ping then access D1 from console and shut down either the bgp link or the OSPF link and you will notice failover will happen much faster On a side note you mentioned that D1 router is learning a given prefix from OSPF and ebgp and its installing the OSPF route If you think about it that shouldnt happen because ebgp AD is 20 and OSPF is 110 so it should install the ebgp route and not OSPF The reason its not installing ebgp route is because you are redistributing OSPF prefixes into bgp and when redistributed routes appear in the RIB they win over the prefixes advertised by the ebgp neighbor because of the weight value Check the bgp table on D1 and you will see redistributes routes are preferred
EIGRP Default Route AD Change,Hi Everyone I’m trying to come up with a solution for redundancy to our MPLS network and DMVPN seems like the obvious choice Everything around DMVPN is working My issue is a routing one I need to be able to adjust the AD of the default route being advertised to R1 from SPOKE using EIGRP I don’t want to affect any other routes other than the default Seems like such a simple thing to do Maybe I’ve just been staring at this thing to long If I could change the AD for prefix 00000 to 10 this will give us a preferred path to the Internet out our local ISP and a backup over the MPLS Much thanks J Solved Go to Solution,Been thinking about this R1 is receiving the default route from Spoke and R2 Im assuming that by the way routing is configured R1 sees both default routes as equal cost and has both in its routing table Perhaps if you adjust the delay metrics on the link between Spoke and R1 the Spoke default route would be preferred over R2 Similarly you could increase the delay metric between R1 and R2 and achieve the same result Regards RVCE So I assume that Spoke and R2 are the ones advertising the default static routes via EIGRP If so you could advertise the default route from the Spoke normally and give the R2 a weighted static with a greater administrative distance For example ip route 0000 0000 xxxx 200 Spoke would be 170 This way R2 would not propagate the 0000 route until the Spoke stops its advertisement Hope this helps RVCE Yes sorry if I didnt make that clear There is a default originate coming across through the MPLS that R2 is advertising The spoke is advertising the default route based on an SLA If the SLA fails then the MPLS route will pick up Note  the SLA needs to be on the spoke as there are more than one ISP Static is an option but not one Im real excited about In BGP this is a slam dunk with the ability to match on a prefix With EIGRP it doesnt seem like there is a way to prefix match and modify the AD based on the match although it seems like there should be RVCE Been thinking about this R1 is receiving the default route from Spoke and R2 Im assuming that by the way routing is configured R1 sees both default routes as equal cost and has both in its routing table Perhaps if you adjust the delay metrics on the link between Spoke and R1 the Spoke default route would be preferred over R2 Similarly you could increase the delay metric between R1 and R2 and achieve the same result Regards RVCE Hi Chrihussey K values you study them know them and wonder when will I use them Well today was that day So what I did was increase the delay on R1 for the interface where the MPLS routes are learned from It works and so far I havent seen anything negative associated with it Thanks to you cofee and all the others who are helping provide solutions J RVCE Hi This is what I understand you are trying to achieve R1 is currently receiving two default routes 1 from the spoke router and another from r2 and you want spoke router to advertise the default route to R1with an AD 0f 10 If my understanding is correct than you can achieve this by following configuration on R1 accesslist 1 permit 0000 255255255255  router eigrp xx distance 10 1111 0000 1 1111 is the source address and 0000 is wild card mask so you will replace 1111 with whatever address spoke is using as next hop value when it advertise default route to r1 and 1 is the acceslist number   Below I have two outputs from the lab with and without route manipulation Gateway of last resort is 35115 to network 0000 D 00000 9030720 via 35115 000310 FastEthernet01 9030720 via 34114 000310 FastEthernet00 Gateway of last resort is 34114 to network 0000 D 00000 1030720 via 34114 000118 FastEthernet00 RVCE Hi Cofee Thanks for your suggestions I should probably clarify a couple of things The Spoke router is redistributing the default route It is not learned There is an SLA monitoring Internet reachability If the SLA fails the route is removed and the one learned from the MPLS should be used The distance option with the ACL changes all learned routes and not the redistributed ones Maybe there is a better way to accomplish redundancy for Internet Thanks J RVCE Hi Distance option will only change AD for the subnets that are matched in the ACL RVCE Hi I see what you are saying Manipulation of AD using ACLs in conjunction with distance or setting metric under the routemap seem to have no affect on redistributed routes no matter where you configure it I believe even changing the AD of external eigrp routes wont help because both default routes are being learned by R1 as external eigrp You can tweak the metric as Chrihussey has suggested but this would affect all other prefixes as well learnedadvertised by eigrp to overcome that you can use the distance feature for all the internal eigrp prefixes to prefer one over the other Not sure if PBR will be beneficial in this situation without knowing the details I cant think of resolving this any other way in my opinion you would need to make these tweaks to achieve the target traffic flow Traffic engineering features are limited when it comes to IGPs

Are standard DS1 DS3 and OC3 SONET or ATM Circuits,Are standard T1s DS3s and OC3s going into standard Cisco Router interface cards such as on 7200 28002900 38003900 considered SONET or ATM Can anyone provide a brief overview of the difference between these Several carriers are discontinuing their ATM and other legacy services and it makes me wonder how do you tell if circuits are ATM or SONET and what is the difference Solved Go to Solution,It turns out the local carrier uses SONET rather than ATM not really sure if much ATM is used around here I had a feeling that was the case since the interface on my OC3 router has a POS interface card Packet over Sonet I hope that means LOL Thanks for the info RVCE If youre working with a physical connection to a DS ATM SONET etc link you would need an interface that supports that physical mediaWhat you might encounter today is a WAN provider providing an Ethernet handoff but the providers network might not be using Ethernet RVCE The physical handoff is DS1 DS3 or OC3 very limited Ethernet provider handoff in our area I was just wondering if this handoff would be considered SONET or ATM since providers seem to be discontinuing a lot of their ATM circuits even though they tell me this shouldnt affect us it got me thinking as to how we determine if a circuit is SONET or ATM and what the differences between them are RVCE    how we determine if a circuit is SONET or ATM   You would find that out from your WAN provider It helps to know what interface you need before a circuit in installed     circuit is SONET or ATM and what the differences between them areDoubt I could do justice to that question in a short reply You should be able to find out much information about both if you search the Internet For examplehttpsenwikipediaorgwikiAsynchronousTransferModehttpsenwikipediaorgwikiSynchronousopticalnetworkinghttpsenwikipediaorgwikiOpticalCarriertransmissionrates RVCE It turns out the local carrier uses SONET rather than ATM not really sure if much ATM is used around here I had a feeling that was the case since the interface on my OC3 router has a POS interface card Packet over Sonet I hope that means LOL Thanks for the info
Router interface redirection,Hello  Im here because i face a problem since yesterday ill explain as clearly as possible  I have 2 routeurs 3745 connected via 2 links GRE tunnels separated by some routers here is a simple representation not my actual structure but enought to represent it  I forgot to add a pc but lets do with that On my ethernetswitch1 there is 2 vlans vlan 16 and 18 and on the other switch there is 1 vlan 19 what i wanted is when the PC5 try to reach the vlan 16 he goes through the tunnel 0 the upper one and when he try to reach the vlan 18 he goes through the tunnel 1 the bottom oneBut there is my problem i didnt succed in that i tried to change priority calculated by protocols ospf eigrp between them but for that i changed the bandwidth and when it change the priority its for all vlans so not what i wantNext i tried things like ACL  routemap policy routemap etc but anything that ive done dont work the ACLs seemed to match the correct ip addresses but no redirection were done So my question is simple does someone can help me a little  Is ACLs  routemap the good solution and i just failed it or is there other solutions  Thanks in advance ,Hello I couldnt see the image but I thing I understand what you want can you please provide the configuration you used with the ACLs You can use Policy Based Routing to force the traffic the way you want Do not forget to ratemark useful post Best Regards RVCE I tried differents configurations with ACLs but there is just one that looks correct   The one who must allow traffic from 19216819024 to 19216816024 and redirect it after  config ip accesslist extended ACLIN1916 configextnacl permit ip 192168190 000255 192168160 000255 configextnacl exit config routemap 19to16 permit 10configroutemap match ip address ACLIN1916 configroutemap set ip nexthop 1031315 1031315 is the address of the end of the tunnel through which i want this traffic to pass  And then the same but from 19216819024 to 19216818024  config ip accesslist extended ACLIN1918 configextnacl permit ip 192168190 000255 192168180 000255 configextnacl exit config routemap 19to18 permit 10configroutemap match ip address ACLIN1918 configroutemap set ip nexthop 1021215 And finally  config int tun 0 configif ip policy routemap 19to18 configif int tun 1 configif ip policy routemap 19to16 But with that nothing happen no redirection or anything did i missed something  And sorry for the late answer RVCE Ive found my problem but there is a other now  the ip policy routemap command should be done in the interface that lead to my subnet 19216819024 and not tunnel interfaces ive done it and it work The problem now  I can have just one policy routemap per interface but i have two routemap what can i do  RVCE Hello Tusune Yes you are right you cant use two PBRs into the same interface so you have to create only one PBR with two policies using the same ACLs config ip accesslist extended ACLIN1916 configextnacl permit ip 192168190 000255 192168160 000255 exit config ip accesslist extended ACLIN1918 configextnacl permit ip 192168190 000255 192168180 000255 exit configroutemap REDIRECTION permit 10configroutemap match ip address ACLIN1916 configroutemap set ip nexthop 1031315 configroutemap REDIRECTION permit 20configroutemap match ip address ACLIN1918 configroutemap set ip nexthop 1021215 Please do not forget to ratemark useful post Regards RVCE Hi Use one routemap instead of twoLike this routemap MYPOLICY permit 10 match ip address ACLIN1916 set ip nexthop 1031315 routemap MYPOLICY permit 20 match ip address ACLIN1918 set ip nexthop 1021215 Mikael RVCE It works thanks for all

Cisco ASA allowing blocked IP address through ACL,Hi All I have a strange one  I have an outside interface allowing only a few IP addresses inbound to a natted server There is an implicit deny at the end I have recently noticed attempts to log into this server from a random  denined IP  The logs show it building a connection successfully  this is how it is able to reach the login page  But the ACL is denying it  If I test with packet tracer on the firewall from the malicious IP to the server address it says it is blocked Can any one explain how this could happen  I am concerned the ASA5525  96 2  may have a bug but I cannot see any Thanks Craig,Hello post the config of your ASA
Transit Fabric with SD Access,Can someone point me to some documentation that details on the role of Transit Fabric In a TechField Day video Shawn talked about VXLAN from Fabric A to Fabric B will go through a Transit Fabric Not sure why I need a Fabric since VXLAN packet can be encapsulated and transported over any L3 network Also in case of Transit Fabric does it acts a Master LISP server which gets updates from all the LISP enabled Control Nodes its attached to  Appreciate any response in advance,
Does the Cisco SD Access Enabled APs act as VTEP,Reading the SD Access CVD I am trying to figure out if the SD Access enabled APs will do the VXLAN encapdecap of the wireless traffic themselves or will it forward it to the Fabric Edge Nodes to do the VXLAN encapdecap If the former can those APs act as a full fledged VTEP,Hello reading through the document you have mentioned here is how I understand it Assuming a fabric mode AP Cisco 80211AC Wave 2  includes Aironet 3800 28001800 Series  and Wave 1 APs  is deployed these do the VXLAN traffic encapsulation for wireless traffic while it moves between the wireless and the wired portions of the fabric However the APs are not edge nodes so they cannot function a VTEPs I might be off here but that is my understanding RVCE Thanks Georg But to do encap and decap the AP need to be a VTEP running VTEP tables Also just to do a VXLAN tunnel for the wireless traffic from the AP to the Edge switch doesn’t makes sense it must be end to end and both the encaping and decaping device need to be a VTEP Im reading through the data sheets of the compatible APs and don’t see any mention about VXLAN RVCE Any Cisco Experts Want to take a stab
switches ssh and telnet,i have more then 50 switches some of them is cisco 2960l 2960i 3650i and some of them 3850nmwe can successfully ping all of them or successfully ssh them but there is one switch 3650i that switch we cant ssh or telnet  even we cant ping that one but if i logon first other switch then ping or ssh that switch we can do thatwhy that switch we cant ping or ssh directly what we should have to do for direct access that switch,Assuming all the switchs management interfaces are on a common network  VLAN it sounds as if the switch you are having the issue with may not have the correct default gateway or mask RVCE all switches in same management vlan mask is same all configuration is same RVCE Is the default gateway correct and can the switch ping it RVCE Its very rare but occasionally Ive seen an IOS operating incorrectly such that some functions work fine and some do not What seems to cure this is a reloadIf you can reload the device and see if the behavior remains the same RVCE this time i cant restart device but i will try if my manager give a downtime for thatany other suggestion that we do in running time RVCE Not beyond those offered by ChrisBTW are you running recommended IOS versions If not a reload could be a good time to move to a more stable IOS versionA couple of months back had a 4500 that became sick In that case it was still forwarding traffic and could telnet to it but couldnt load a newer IOS on it The reason for the newer IOS was it was considered by Cisco more stable Ie not directly due to the forgoing issue Had to reload it with the existing version after the reload we were then able to load the newer IOS on in and of course had to reload it again RVCE ohhhhhh which version is suitable for that  because we have recently upgrade that device ios now it run on 1663 ios version  before this it run on 1563b RVCE You look for the recommendation release stars RVCE best is 1663 and it is also installedany other suggestion or solution sir  RVCE Not at this time
Router throughput,Hi we have 1 Gbps symmetrical internet connectionAnd we are planning to buy Cisco ISR4321 however in specs I read that aggregate throughput is 50 to 100 Mbps Can someone explain what does it meanAre we going to have 1Gbps or 50100 Mbps at our servers network interface if our network look like this 1Gbps InternetCisco 4321Server,Hi Simple and basic is that it can handle maximum 100 Mbps data by this router If you wan speed is really 1Gbps bandwidth then it is not suitable for you Q Are we going to have 1Gbps or 50100 Mbps at our servers network interface if our network look like this 1Gbps InternetCisco 4321Server Ans 50100 Mbps I think Cisco router 4451 is good for you Regards Deepak Kumar RVCE MSRP for Cisco ISR4321 is 199500 and can handle maximum 100 MbpsNoName 150 home router easily handles 1Gbps internet connectionCan someone explain that as well RVCE Go HERE and HERE See if the 150 has these features or not RVCE Oh and in addition to features found on an ISR that arent found on a 150 home router if either device is found to have any bugs Cisco generally fixes theirs  the 150 home routers bugs may or may not be fixedBe assured businesses would much rather spend 150 than thousands but they also like to insure the network is usable

160603All traffic has to go thru GRE to reach data center and internet at Corp HQ The remote site GREs all terminate on a 4451X in the data center I get occasional complaints from this site that phones drop When I look at the Network Monitor I often see the bandwidth at or very near the 50 Mbs NetFlow v9 IDs a couple of bandwidth hogs  usually copying a huge 12 gig file to a network drive etc So I started looking into what I could do and realize that I should probably setup some sort of class  policy Maps on the 4331 to preserve bandwidth I think that the policymap needs to go on the GRE TU rather than the physical Gig interface that is the service provider connection  since all the traffic goes through the GRE I am looking for suggestions  comments on the following classmap matchany

Interface tunnel0 servicepolicy output SHAPER PLACES QOS MARKINGS IN GRE HEADER  qos preclassify TIA  Perry,Hi Perry Looks good but the service policy should be applied on the physical interface towards the provider Sometimes for certain paltforms you have to decrease the value for the shaper a little because the layer2 overhead is not calculated in the shaper Otherwise you can be sending a slite more traffic than 50M and if the provider is policing to 50M he may drop some of your traffic Mikael RVCE HiShould qos preclassify be used here to make sure the DSCP markings are copied to the GRE header RVCE By default except for very very old IOS versions original packets ToS is copied to encapsulated packets ToS The purpose of preclassify is to allow a physical interface policy to examine a shadow copy of some of the original packets other fields like UDPIP port numbers If youre just looking at the ToS you dont need preclassify RVCE Youre on the righttrack but a lot more might be neededAs you mention MPLS and sites plural if you have more than two sites ideally you need QoS support from your MPLS provider tooEach site should PQ or LLQ VoIP bearer traffic as it sends traffic into the MPLS cloud If the available egress bandwidth is less than the physical handoff provides then you should shape for that bandwidth with a subordinate policy  as youre doingSignally traffic also should be protected ie insure it has guaranteed bandwidth for whatever it needs  again like youre doingBTW if your device supports it I would recommend FQ for classdefault  for all your other traffic  goes a long way dealing with a few bandwidth hog flowsWith a multisite cloud of more than two sites you also need to insure QoS for traffic as it egresses the cloud For example an HQ site might overrun any one branchs link capacity or perhaps multiple branches can overrun the any other one site including the HQ There is where you need MPLS QoS If thats not possible you can shape sites to avoid overrunning other sites you take into account all other sites aggregate maximum bandwidth but as the sites do not know what other sites are doing to fully protect critical traffic like VoIP bearer you end up loosing available bandwidth RVCE Thanks for the replies QoS configuration is definitely a dark science My MPLS subscribed network bandwidth is 900Mbs I have many termite sites at various bandwidths feeding into our MPLS cloud We use GRE tunnels anchored to loopbacks through the MPLS to our corporate data center and our DR site The DR site routes are weighted to be less preferred I talked to TAC and he thinks the policy needs to be applied to GRE rather than the physical Gig IF but not sure  Also believes the preclassify is needed to ensure priority markings are placed in to GRE header before its encrypted The “last mile” to this site is provided by Spectrum fiber It is a 50Mbs link and our network monitor has confirmed the site reaches it I was told the network honors QoS  priority but I will address that after I have a policy applied that consensus here agrees is correct I am looking for help getting correct policy so voice is protected when the users at the site bury the link with their large file copies etc RVCE Thanks for the replies QoS configuration is definitely a dark science My MPLS subscribed network bandwidth is 900Mbs I have many

lot to due with it being poorly explained andor not taught much The TAC response being a case in point Also believes the preclassify is needed to ensure priority markings are placed in to GRE header before its encrypted SighBTW sometimes when QoS is done right application performance improvement can be magicallyI talked to TAC and he thinks the policy needs to be applied to GRE rather than the physical Gig IF but not sure Yes and no It depends on what youre doing Sometimes you want a policy on both the tunnels and the physical interface although not all Cisco devices support thatFor example if you logically had a hubandspoke topology or thats how your traffic mainly flows you would shape each tunnel for the far sides bandwidth with a subordinate policy to prioritize but you would still want a physical policy on the interface in case the tunnels aggregate traffic overruns it Again if the physical interface had more bandwidth than a logical cap you would shape the physical even though the tunnels would also be shaped Also again unless the physical interface needs to examine more than ToS you dont need preclassifyYoull want to find out more about your MPLS providers QoS support The reason why ideally you want your policy to work with it or possibly around it Also sometimes MPLS providers can provide different QoS often from a menu of choicesPSBTW have you optimized how youve configured your tunnels The impact of fragmentation can be significant Are you sure you need tunnels Often tunnels across MPLS are needed if youre doing multicast and the MPLS vendor doesnt support it

BGP Question,Hi All This may be a remedial question but do you have to advertise a local network for the BGP peering to come up I have very little experience with BGP Thanks in advance Best,Hi The address that you use for bgp peering mush be reachable For iBGP peering you can use an igp for reachability and ttl by default is 255 in ibgp In ebgp by default the ttl value is 1 but it can be increased If you are using a directly connected interface in ebgp then reachability will be there without any additional configuration but if you decide to use a loopback address for ebgp peering then you can use a static route for reachability to loopback addresses and either increase the hopcount or disable the connected check RVCE Hi Coffee So its safe to say for eBGP peering you need to specify a network in the BGP configuration RVCE Hi lets say you have 2 routers that are directly connected and using 1921681030 address space and you are using directly connected network for the peering Below is sample configuration router 1 router bgp 100 neighbor 19216812 remoteas 200 router 2 router bgp 200 neighbor 19216811 remoteas 100  now I am not sure what you meant by specifying networks If you are talking about using the network command in bgp then that is used when you are advertising a network to your bgp peer RVCE Sweet I was told I had to use the network command to initiate peering with the provider by specifying internal networks that you want to advertise I appreciate your patience RVCE Hello on a side note have a look at the configuration example below R1 interface GigabitEthernet00 description Link to R2 ip address 19216811 255255255252 router bgp 1 neighbor 19216812 remoteas 2 R2 interface GigabitEthernet00 description Link to R1 ip address 19216812 255255255252 router bgp 2 neighbor 19216811 remoteas 1  the neighbors will be up without doing anything In this example R1 interface Loopback0 ip address 1111 255255255255 interface GigabitEthernet00 description Link to R2 ip address 19216811 255255255252 router bgp 1 neighbor 2222 remoteas 2 neighbor 2222 ebgpmultihop 2 neighbor 2222 updatesource Loopback0 R2 interface Loopback0 ip address 2222 255255255255 interface GigabitEthernet00 description Link to R1 ip address 19216812 255255255252 router bgp 2 neighbor 1111 remoteas 1 neighbor 1111 ebgpmultihop 2 neighbor 1111 updatesource Looback0  neighbors will not establish even if you advertise the local networks You either need a static route pointing to the respective loopback address or as cofee mentioned an IGP So this will not work R1 interface Loopback0 ip address 1111 255255255255 interface GigabitEthernet00 description Link to R2 ip address 19216811 255255255252 router bgp 1 neighbor 2222 remoteas 2 neighbor 2222 ebgpmultihop 2 neighbor 2222 updatesource Loopback0 network 2222 mask 255255255255 network 19216810 mask 255255255252 R2 interface Loopback0 ip address 2222 255255255255 interface GigabitEthernet00 description Link to R1 ip address 19216812 255255255252 router bgp 2 neighbor 1111 remoteas 1 neighbor 1111 ebgpmultihop 2 neighbor 1111 updatesource Looback0 network 1111 mask 255255255255 network 19216810 mask 255255255252 And this will R1 interface Loopback0 ip address 1111 255255255255 interface GigabitEthernet00 description Link to R2 ip address 19216811 255255255252 router bgp 1 neighbor 2222 remoteas 2 neighbor 2222 ebgpmultihop 2 neighbor 2222 updatesource Loopback0 ip route 2222 255255255255 19216812 R2 interface Loopback0 ip address 2222 255255255255 interface GigabitEthernet00 description Link to R1 ip address 19216812 255255255252 router bgp 2 neighbor 1111 remoteas 1 neighbor 1111 ebgpmultihop 2 neighbor 1111 updatesource Looback0 ip route 1111 255255255255 19216811 And this will work as well R1 interface Loopback0 ip address 1111 255255255255 interface GigabitEthernet00 description Link to R2 ip address 19216811 255255255252 router eigrp 1 network 0000 router bgp 1 neighbor 2222 remoteas 2 neighbor 2222 ebgpmultihop 2 neighbor 2222 updatesource Loopback0 R2 interface Loopback0 ip address 2222 255255255255 interface GigabitEthernet00 description Link to R1 ip address 19216812 255255255252 router eigrp 1 network 0000 router bgp 2 neighbor 1111 remoteas 1 neighbor 1111 ebgpmultihop 2 neighbor 1111 updatesource Looback0 RVCE router bgp 2 neighbor 1111 remoteas 1 neighbor 1111 updatesource Looback0 network 1111 mask 255255255255 Simple Explanation of this is under 1 Router bgp 2 means my BGP AS is 2 2 neighbor 1111 remoteas 1 means my peers BGP AS is 1 3 neighbor 1111 updatesource Looback0 means reachability between my loopback0 and 1111 IP should be OKSimply means this should ping using my loopback 0 as source 4 network 1111 mask 255255255255 means I will advertise 111132 in my BGP updates if this prefix is eligble for BGP routing announcements Reach ability between bgp peering IPs does not always require a routing protocol it may be through static routing as well Vikram SisodiaCCIE 49587JNCIAJunOS

Is an ACL needed when using PAT,We have a single router 4331 that connects to our ISP We do PAT dynamic nat to give users internet access Now typically wed have an OUTSIDEIN ACL that blocks traffic from the internet My question is if were using PAT and have no static 1to1 translations do we even need an ACL If yes what would be the attack that an ACL would prevent,Are you using the ZBF functionality on the 4331 If yes then youd want an outsidein ACL that allows any inbound traffic that isnt already return traffic from inspection If you are not using ZBF then it us up to you if you want to use an ACL but it is not manditory It would depend if you want to deny certain protocols inbound See below for an example to block inbound telnet except from one IP ip accesslist extended outsidein permit tcp host 1111 any eq 23 deny tcp any any eq 23 permit ip any any interface g001 ip accessgroup outsidein in
show ip bgp neighbor xxxx receivedroutes with multiple routing protocols,If I execute the command show ip bgp neighbor xxxx receivedroutes and the router is learning a particular route via another routing protocol with a lower cost as well will that route be omitted from the output of that command For example I am learning a route via OSPF from one neighbor and iBGP from another neighbor Ospf wins due to AD and so the OSPF route is injected into the local routing table If I execute the command show ip bgp neighbor xxxx receivedroutes where I specify the iBGP neighbor by IP shouldnt I see that route as a received route from the iBGP neighbor regardless of what route is in my routing table Thanks,Yes prefix should appear in the bgp rib But make sure that ibgp neighbor is advertising the prefix in question bgp speaking router will only advertise best routesprefixes and also keep in mind that iBGP neighbors dont advertise prefix that they learned from another ibgp neighbor to another iBGP neighbors to overcome this issue you can either configure route reflectors or confederation You can run following command to make sure if the neighbor is advertising the prefix through bgp sh ip bgp neighbor xxxx advertisedroutes RVCE Thanks Cofee Unfortunately I dont have access to that router its a Verizon core router I can see that it is being advertised into BGP from the edge where the network lives but dont see it from another location coming from the core using that command I do see it coming from another neighbor via OSPF via backup circuit When we suppressed the route via prefix list in OSPF configuration it populated the routing table from BGP I just thought I should have seen the prefix in bgp receivedroutes RVCE Whether you suppress or unsuppress it via ospf the prefix should be there if its being advertised to you Please run sh ip bgp and see if the prefix is present in the bgp rib

RVCE Hi Those networks are outside and they cannot be natedI also tried with the ACL only instead of the ROUTEMAP but the result is the sameThe problem is not on the outbound outbound is working fine the problem is inbound the traffic reaches the router but it is not being sent to the server inside Regards RVCE You need to check your routing my friendfor the server to be natted it needs reachability to the nat router and vice versa I have simulated it and it works for me with two commands R4R3INR1OUTR2ip nat inside source list TEST interface FastEthernet00 overload  outside

route on 1921681010 that allows it to return the traffic back to wherever the RDP session is coming from Can you run wireshark on the end host to see it if receives anything RVCE Im not able to run wireshark Im working remotelyThe server only has one interface connected with 192168101024 with gateway 19216810254 I also tested using a NAT for a switch inside the network using telnetI can access the switch from the router and validated that everything is configured properly but I cannot access the switch from outside the behaviour is the same RVCE I simulated it again  the first time I did this I did not configure dot1q trunking on the LAN side With dot1q trunking configured I replicate the same as what you see  the router and host can see each other but I cannot get all the way through from a host on the outside A bit of wiresharking shows the SYN from the host on the outside goes through the router the server returns a SYN  ACK but when it traverses the router the source address remains the same 1921681010 rather than being translated to the router WAN interface IP adddress Strangely if I connect remove the dot1q from the router interface and just have both the router and the server as access ports in VLAN10 it works normally No idea why this would be the case  is this something you can try RVCE I need to go there personally Remotely is not easy to change that I might lose connectivity to the switch RVCE I put the dot1q config back in place and change the nat statement to beip nat inside source static tcp 1921681010 23 1010101 23 extendableie I referenced the actual public IP address rather than the interface and it worked again Dont really understand why though
setup second bgp router to second ISP,Hello we currently have our internet router connected to 1 ISP We would like to purchase a second router and have it connect to a different ISP The 2 ISPs will not talk iBGP but our routers will The attached diagram shows what the topology will hopefully look like We are currently getting only a default route from our ISP and will do so with the 2nd ISP We are trying to achieve a primary secondary function The 2nd router will only serve as a backup no loadsharing or anything in case the 1st router dies From what I understand Localpref marks routes we get from the ISP so it will alter how we send our internal routes out We would ideally set Router1 primary with higher local prefence for all our internal networks and set a lower localpref on the 2nd router to be the backup this would be advertised within our AS so the 2 routers know what the deal is Is this really all we need We just make a routemap that captures all the internal traffic like 1010100 and 1111110 and sets a local pref on it right From what I understand we might not really need pathprepend here since its just what we advertise to our ISPs and since we only have a deafult route out and the ISPs dont do iBGP I guess pathprepend might be redundant in this situation Please correct me Thank you in advance Router1Router bgp 100bgp log neighbor changesneighbor router2

local prefernce 150 Is this configuration coming close to achieving what Im looking for or am I really off here ,Hello Do you have MPLS link from your ISP 1 and 2  I mean do you have some network ressources in datacenter I will assume not and suppose you have Public IP address on your WAN interface on both router  you have to configure VRRP or HSRP on client side with high priority on router 1 side to have gw on this side  if you do that changing localpref is not needed because all traffic from client will go through router 1 and the shortest path will be through this router to ISP1  on the other side it is always a good idea to filter received route from EBGP router so you can apply prefixlist in input like this  router bgp 100 neighbor IPISP1 remoteas 200 neighbor IPISP1 prefixlist DEFAULTROUTE in  ip prefixlist DEFAULTROUTE seq 10 permit 00000  If BGP adjacency will shut off on router 1 you will have in your routing table on router 1 another default route through router 2 But this is not efficient because you have master hsrp on router 1 SO to have both client GW and routing through router you will need the next point  you need to track the wan interface on router 1 to allow GW failover to router 2 something like this  track 33 interface gigabitethernet01 lineprotocolint vlan 1description LANUSERip address 101010253 2552552550standby 1 ip 101010254standby 1 priority 110standby 1 track 33 decrement 20standby 1 preempt Dont forget to put preempt in order to come back on router 1 when link to ISP is up Hope I dont have made a mistake i have just a doubt regarding defaultroute when router1 is active Not sure if you should have 2 defaultroute or one Will try this tommorow You will change public ip address when failover on router2 btw RVCE I realized I made a mistake by specifying the wrong neighbor on Router 2 commands I posted it is now corrected Correct we are getting public IP addresses from our ISP no MPLS The thing is that we have iBGP neighborship between our 2 routers I dont think we need to use HSRP am I correct And just to make matters worse I uploaded the edited attachment I also made a mistake there too You will see the fix and I tried to make our internal topology more detailed The 2 ISP feeds come into our switch that connects via VLANs into our Routers12 RVCE Ok but who is gw for client lan  routers or switch  You are mixing layer 2 and l3 on your pic not very easy to understand RVCE it is confusing but thats how the network is setup I adjusted the diagram sorry for making this confusing i realized i made a mistake Vlan 400red line is currently the main ISP 1 gateway out to Router 1 Vlan 500blue line is used for ISP 2 backup We have everything in place we just havent configured the 2nd router yet to be a failover There are 30 IP address spaces on the 4 interfaces between Router 1 and 2 The ISP circuit terminates at Switch 30 it does not terminate at the routers We use switch 30 just for bridging For our current traffic flow just follow the red lines to the router 1 and back out to the ISP 1 feed RVCE Ok again but who is gw for client lan routers or switch You can have ibgpebgp somewhere but you need to have a default route for client thats what I saidI had some time to verify something and you dont need to adjust localpref because you have EBGP with telco provider So administrative distance is prefered

are not confident with this configuration try it on virtual lab before production You should understand before to configure RVCE Hello What type of ISPs are they Do they both share the same parent tier provider or is it that one of them is a child to the other it this is the case then resiliency isnt really true if an outage occurs to the parent of higher the tier isp  this you can check with the ISP themselvesThe topology you posted is a proposed solution correct Is there any specific reason why you would wont both routers peering to both the two independently ISPs if you dont require any load sharing You say the isps dont provide ibgp but they do off ebgp correct based on the example configuration you have posted If bgp is to be used then you can utilize both isps connections one on either router and receive a default from both of them at the same time An igp default can then be advertised via ospf into your L3 core with a preferred default E1 v E2 This advertisement would be based on each rtrs reliability to it own ISP default The result being you l3 will always have default pointing to a valid internet path res Paul Please dont forget to rate any posts that have been helpfulThanks RVCE The topology I proposed is actually how it already is My predecessor could never figure out how to configure a backup link with the 2nd ISP we already have configured Everything in that drawing is how it is right now but its just sitting there not doing anything except for ISP 1 and Router 1 which is what were using right now for our internet Router 2 and ISP 2 link are not being used I could loadshare I just never thought about it that 2nd circuit is much smaller and only to provide backup for more important things in case of a failure to answer your first questions they are 2 completely separate companies I think I only said the ISPs dont do iBGP because i heard they dont one of the reasons why this project is challenging is because I dont know much about the ISP side of things RVCE I figure its easier if I just post a new discussion and post the configs of the 2 routers Doing that now RVCE Hello If you do that then you will just be asked the same questions until we can obtain a better understanding of your topology Also you will have then two discussions ongoing relating to the same query So my next question would be to share the configuration of the the active rtr if it applicable to do so sh run configsh ip protocolssh ip route res Paul Please dont forget to rate any posts that have been helpfulThanks
Cisco 1921  4GLTE EHWIC   Primary Int G00 and Backup Cellular 000 Issues,Hello I am looking for some help solving a problem with a Cisco 1921 and the Verizon 4G EHWIC card I have configured the router and it is working and was looking to add the 4G as a backup to the primary connection G00 The cell interface is at Cellular000 If I add the following command ip address negotiated to the cellular interface then the G00 basically stops working and I loose all internet connectivity until that startment is removed I dont understand why this is occurring Any help would be appreciated The only item I can think of is adding the additional something with NAT not configured correctly for that interface Does not seem that the cellular interface dials when the G00 interface goes down I have researched and have tried many different changes but nothing is fixing this issue The firmware is up to date on the modem and the IOS is 1553 Thanks in advance for any advice Below is the snippet of the config with sections removed to keep size down that does not pertain I believe Also included below is the cellular interface info version 155no service padservice tcpkeepalivesinservice

InformationModem crashdump logging off,I have played a lot with these interfaces and if the interface drops when getting your IP it could be a NAT issue The reason the interface drops is because of something called an IP source violation If the provider sees traffic coming in through the cell interface that isnt properly NATed the connection will drop What you can do is create an accesslist denying all inside traffic from traversing the cell interface Btw where is your NAT ACL for your natlist Also I noticed that none of your cellular profiles are active Try enabling the interface again using an ACL to block RFC 1918 IPs from going out of the interface and let me know what happens Ive had to troubleshoot these a lot Here is an example of our config interface Cellular000 description To Verizon Cellular Network ip address negotiated no ip unreachables ip nat outside ip virtualreassembly in encapsulation slip loadinterval 30 shutdown dialer inband dialer idletimeout 0 dialer

watchlist 1 delay routecheck initial 60dialer watchlist 1 delay connect 1dialerlist 1 protocol ip permitip nat inside source routemap NATCELL interface Cellular000 overload PS I havent included the routemap or ACLs for the NAT config RVCE Thanks for responding I appreciate the insight I was going to add the following statement to my config thinking this might be part of the problem because it is not included Your info kind of validates my thoughts on the NAT issue ip nat inside source list natlist interface Cellular000 overload I have not manged to get any of the profiles to show active that is another item that I cannot figure out so far This has been frustrating The interface is a backup ONLY to G00 Would the profile become active once the G00 interface goes downThanks for help in this situation I appreciate it Fred RVCE Yes you need to make sure you NAT out of the cellular interface as well AT least one of the profiles should show active once your connection to the cellular network is established regardless if G00 is up or down RVCE So adding that ip nat statement is for sure As far as the dial portion of the config do I need to add that I dont have any of the 3 below statements in my config dialer watchlist 1 ip 5678 0000dialer watchlist 1 delay routecheck initial 60dialer watchlist 1 delay connect 1 I do have the following includedchatscript lte  AT1CALL TIMEOUT 60 OK

linkrecovery debouncecount 6 line 000 script dialer lte modem InOut no execdialerlist 1 protocol ip permit RVCE Its my understanding that the dialer watch list will basically keep the cellular interface up at all times instead of just connecting when establishing a call Adding those 3 dialer watchlist commands definitely wont hurt RVCE Do I really need it up all the time if it is a backup just in case the other interface goes down RVCE We have ours up all the time and we are using it as a backup connection as well We just have the cell connection as a default floating static route with a higher AD than our primary interface The choice is up to you RVCE Thanks for help on this Do I have to create a new ACL for NAT for that interface I have not done many still learning in and outs of CLI What is you recommendation on setting this up My current ACLs are below ip accesslist extended diskstationacl permit objectgroup diskstationsvc objectgroup diskstationsrcnet objectgroup diskstationdstnetip accesslist extended energydetectiveacl permit objectgroup energydetectivesvc objectgroup energydetectivesrcnet objectgroup energydetectivedstnetip accesslist extended lanacl permit

mobilenetextenderdstnetip accesslist extended natlist permit ip objectgroup locallansubnets any deny ip any anyip accesslist extended rdpserveracl permit objectgroup rdpserversvc objectgroup rdpserversrcnet objectgroup rdpserverdstnet What would the command be to set this correctly I am guessing after the ACL is set then I should add the below ip nat inside source list natcell interface Cellular000 overload Once again thanks for your help on this Great expertise on this Seems like you have had a lot of experience with this Fred RVCE Hello Chris Well I had a chance to work on this and here is what happensyou can correct me when and wherever I made a mistake I added the following ACLI think I did it correctly Extended IP access list natcell 10 permit ip objectgroup locallansubnets any 20 deny ip any any This below is the current oneExtended IP access list natlist 10 permit ip objectgroup locallansubnets any 20 deny ip any any Added to the Cellular000 ip address negotiatedThen added the following commandip nat inside source list natcell interface Cellular000 overload Once that was added I lose all internet connectivity until removed What am I doing wrong I did not get profile to go active I also did not try adding dialer statements but that will be next Any suggestions Thanks RVCE Can you be more specific when you say loose all internet connectivity Does this mean that your primary connection drops when you add the ip address negotiated command I would manually shut down your primary connection and attempt troubleshooting the cellular interface until you establish connectivity through the cell Just to be safe I would also at an ACL that denies all private IP address space from exiting the cell interface in order to avoid an IP source violation RVCE I try to ping anything inside IOS and it fails and hence it looks like no connectivity to outside RVCE Im not sure what you mean by that It may be time to open up a TAC case RVCE Basically it seems like the G00 interface stops passing any trafficI will do that as it seems something weird is going on Thanks for all the help RVCE Yeah it shouldnt do that since you have a weighed route pointing to the cell interface The cell interface coming up should not cause G00 to not pass traffic
2 Routers  2 ISP,Hello I have attached a diagram and configs for Router 1 and 2 of what our setup looks like Router 1 and Router 2 belong to us We currently use Router 1 as our main way out to the internet The red links in the picture are vlan 400 configured on switch 30 and the other side router 1 and 2 is configured with a public 30 IP address on their 4 interfaces to the switch 30 The ISP circuits both land on switch 30 AS 200 is our main ISP we currently use AS 300 is our backup My predecessors setup a 2nd ISP blue vlan and links but could never figure out why the failover never worked when AS 200 andor Router 1 would go down The configs look solid Anyone have a clue Thank you in advance Router 1 config RTR1interface GigabitEthernet000 description Inside to Edge Firewall ip

Issue with Zone based Firewall using PFR routing,Hi AllI have set up a branch for IWAN we are using Direct Internet access on the branch router and I have enabled Zone based FirewallWe seem to be running into an issue whereby some return traffic to the hub is being sent to the branch internet router rather than the mpls router the zone based firewall is dropping the packet with the below error010057 Apr 30 135817188 IOSXE6PLATFORM SIP1 cppcp QFP00 Thread000 TS00000353502343871900 FW6DROPPKT Dropping tcp pkt from Tunnel0 XXXX18192  XXXX39262targetclassnonenone due to Firewall invalid zone with ip ident 0 tcp flag 0x12 seq 3117846285 ack 2817640094 It appears that Tunnel 0 is being created by PFR but is not part of any zone How do I fix thischeers,
Create redundant WAN router,Hello in the topology that I have attached we currently have a WAN router model  ISR4451XK9 that is our way out to the MPLS cloud that we pay for We have BGP configured on the WAN Router to neighbor with our Service Provider The WAN router has routed links to our 2 nexus cores We are trying to figure out a way to not have a single point of failure if the wanrouter dies we lose our connectivity to our other branches via the MPLS that we have What are some suggestions to make this more redundant Solved Go to Solution,If you cannot obtain another WAN link your second router would become a coldwarm spare Not much of an advantage for some HA if you have to move the WAN link assuming thats not what failedRegarding VSS for ISR no but as already suggested by others you can use HSRP or GLBP or VRRP However if your router is talking with other routes often you would allow a routing protocol to switch to a second router Virtual gateway protocols are generally used for hosts not between routersBTW if the issue with obtaining a second WAN link is due to cost which it often is with private WANs again look into using VPN across the Internet Private WAN vendors like to tout you have predicable bandwidth and you do but Ive often found little issue using VPN across the Internet RVCE Hi Depends on your budget If you are tight on budget then get SmartNet on existing router in case of no contract and buy a used lower end model and preconfigure the same emergency situation Thx MS RVCE One suggestion would be to get another router and connection to the provider 1 If this is a single location the router should be on a separate power  breaker than the other 2 The second provider link should be as diverse as possible It should have a separate point of entry into the data center not share the same physical route terminate at a different provider POP etc Some things may not be possible but Im sure you get the point A bit of networking would be involved to have the routers communicate and to enable preferences for traffic flow to and from the provider as well as dynamic failover but accomplishing this shouldnt be an overly complicated task and a fairly common requirement As MS has stated a lot depends on the available budget Hope this helps RVCE Hi You could create HSRP or GLBP depending the requeriments on the Nexus and HSRP on the router having 2 Virtual IP address one for the Nexus and one for the Router so the route manipulation will be easy as if you have 1 device on both sides for example Nexus 1 19216802 PRI ROUTER 19216805 HSRP 1 19216801  HSRP 2 19216804 Nexus 2 19216803 SEC ROUTER 19216806 The traffic from the external to the Internal network will have the next hop 19216801 and the traffic from internal to external will have the next hop 19216804 Now the routers facing to the ISP and the ISPs could be connected to switches or stack of switch using a VLANs Hope it is useful  RVCE Thank you Is their some sort of VSS option available for the ISR4451XK9 model Like some sort of HA pair possibility I mean like stacking the ISR4451 with another ISR4451 RVCE There is HSRP running on the 2 cores currently If 1 of the cores fails the vlans will failover to the other core and go up to the wan router just like you statedso theres our insideoutside failover So are you saying that I put in a second wan router ISR4451 and run the HSRP protocol on both the routers now for the outsideinside Thank you I will dig into that So now there is a new twist in this story Lets say that I cant afford another ISP and can only use the same one circuit I have I guess my only option is to physically go to the location and connect the ISP connection to the secondary HSRP if the primary router was to fail right Can you think of any other way to make that redundant Do you think the ISP will provide a failover link if they detect that the router on our end is down like down BGP neighbor I guess I just have to ask them Thanks for your input RVCE As the others have already noted its often a question of how much you want to spend to increase your resiliency As theyve noted one extreme you might just have a contract that expects repair within a certain time frame The other extreme might insure theres no one single point of failure for anythingUnderstand different components have different probabilities of failures different estimates for time to to repair and different costs to deal with either You need to weigh these factors against their impact to your businessFor example is the AC power to your router filtered A power spike could drop your router either transiently or permanently As power filters are inexpensive its inexpensive insurance Or next level whats if theres a power interruption Do you have some form of a UPS Or do you have a dual power option etcIn a situation like yours a relatively inexpensive option might be to use VPN tunnels across the Internet for backup path Especially at the HQ youll probably want a second WAN router for this Internet connection RVCE Thanks everyone for the response Lets assume I have ample budget What would on suggest  RVCE Hi I have ample budget  All you need to do is contact Cisco partner rest assured  Come to your Q Check other experts suggestions all got covered In summary make sure router connected to UPS buy another router with dual PS get additional MPLS provider BGP failover etc Thanks MS RVCE Ok lets say that I cant get a second ISP but I can I have enough money to buy another router Could I VSS aka HA the 2 routers together and connect them with routing protocols to the core RVCE If you cannot obtain another WAN link your second router would become a coldwarm spare Not much of an advantage for some HA if you have to move the WAN link assuming thats not what failedRegarding VSS for ISR no but as already suggested by others you can use HSRP or GLBP or VRRP However if your router is talking with other routes often you would allow a routing

private WANs again look into using VPN across the Internet Private WAN vendors like to tout you have predicable bandwidth and you do but Ive often found little issue using VPN across the Internet RVCE Ok Im glad you brought that up because on the nexus core for the interface that goes up to the WAN router we have EIGRP configured on that interface so routes can get advertised to the WAN router from the core Are you suggesting to not run HSRP on the WAN routers and just add an additional interface and configure EIGRP too on that one and let EIGRP do the failing over in case one of the routers die or something Current core configuration for interface up to wan router Core1 interface Ethernet11 description L3 to WAN no switchport ip address 1211130 ip router eigrp 1 hsrp 1 ip dhcp relay address 105133 no shutdown RVCE Yup RVCE ok thanks for all the info I appreciate everyones input for a noob Now Im wondering if ISP could possibly provide us with a failover link or a dual link in case there is physical problems or something on their end or maybe ours Since we dont have money for an additional ISP I guess all we can do is configure that second router to be the EIGRP secondary failover guy I guess what still lacks is having to actually physically go to the location and actually move the uplink if the main router fails Now Im kind of where I was in the beginning but slightly better Thank you RVCE Hi Joseph I have a similar situation and I am not sure of many things and was wondering if you can help Please see attached topology I want as much redundancy as possible but this is the only equipment I have now I only want to do intervlan routing on the Access switches with SVIs and routing on the Internal Routers with subinterfaces I simply want to be able pass allowed traffic from the different vlan subnets in the lan up through the interconnecting switch sits between Internal routers and FW on out through the FW then to ISP The side of the interfonnect switch that connects to the routers is trunked and I can ping between them The side of the switch that connects to the FW I changed to switchport access vlan 10 and I could then ping the FW My worry is will all traffic from the internal subnets passthrough since it is not a trunk I have a switch there because I did not see how I can connect both routers to the FW  or is there a way to do it I would need same ACL applied to both inside interfaces Once and if I am able to implement another FW then the interconnect switch could go away right since I would just connect each FW to each router but then how do I connect both FWs to on router again I guess my main question is how do you connect redundant routers HSRP same subinterfaces etc to 1 FW or switch and vice versa I cant enter same IPs on interfaces of routers if each connection were to be used to connect to Access switch 1 and 2 If I had the Internal routers both connect to 1 FW would I need to create lets say one interface as inside and another inside2 and apply the same ACLs to them This is why I added an interconnect switch Any advice or help is much appreciated I have attached my topology again
Provider managed mpls router,Hi Trying to determine which router for my private WAN edge the provider will manage the mpls network just need a router at the main office im thinking the isr 4331 for the branches there are about 4 branches with 40 staff per branch looking at 50Mbps at the branches and 100Mbps at the main office with around 100 staff Would the ASR1000s typically be used in this situation Thanks Solved Go to Solution,Would the ASR1000s typically be used in this situationNo You generally only need to consider ASR 1K when you exceed the capacity of the 4K ISR series which is good for a gig or soThe ISR 4 K data specs list their maximum bandwidth throughput As they are logically capped at that its usually easy to match that against your link capacity RVCE Would the ASR1000s typically be used in this situationNo You generally only need to consider ASR 1K when you exceed the capacity of the 4K ISR series which is good for a gig or soThe ISR 4 K data specs list their maximum bandwidth throughput As they are logically capped at that its usually easy to match that against your link capacity RVCE Ok thank you I see the ISRs have various Performance differences i was assuming this was the WAN throughput it was a little unclear Looks like the ISR 4ks max out at 2G which is heaps for me Might just go with the 4ks all round make it a bit easier The ISRs seem to be packed full of features RVCE The bandwidth listed for the ISR 4Ks is the aggregate allowance for all traffic passing through the router If you only use the router for LAN to WAN routing the WAN link is usually your bottleneck and you can size for that BTW dont forget to allow for duplex bandwidth For example if your branch has a 50 Mbps full duplex link you want an ISR 4K that can provide 100 MbpsWhen it comes to selecting an ISR 4K you can select one whose base performance meets your needs or one with a performance upgrade with that license that meets your needs The latter is probably less expensiveYoull also need to decide whether you want a router with capacity beyond your immediate needs or one with excess capacity for later growthLastly the ISR 4Ks may not meet their full capacity spec if doing encryption RVCE Im aiming to use them for a provider managed MPLS VPN network the main office and the branches would be using the ISRs for the WAN connectivity I was looking at an ISR model that meets the requirements now but also can be upgraded later if they need seems to be a good fit The only other thing to mention would be that i want to run the FirePower sensors not sure if that will degrade the performance somewhat or not Thanks for the information RVCE Im unfamiliar with FirePower sensors so unable to comment on their impact if any
APIC EM IWAN Application policy question,Hi AllI have just set up APIC EM Iwan and have a question about the application policy 1What does the App performance switch onoff do exactly does this just allow you to do a path preference or is it as well as path preference2If I leave App performance switched off No App Performance what does it do does it just use basic routing information what is in the FIBcheers,

connected routesIt is a good practice to remove unnecessary static routesip route 19216800 2552552550 FastEthernet002ip route 19216840 2552552550 FastEthernet0042 If you know your ISPs default gateway address on both 1921680024 and 19216840 subnets it is better to specify that address in static route statement instead of pointing to interfaceIf you point a static route to a broadcast interface the route is inserted into the routing table only when the broadcast interface is up This configuration is not recommended because when the next hop of a static route points to an interface the router considers each of the hosts within the range of the route to be directly connected through that interface For example ip route 0000 0000 Ethernet0With this type of configuration a router performs Address Resolution Protocol ARP on the Ethernet for every destination the router finds through the default route because the router considers all of these destinations as directly connected to Ethernet 0This kind of default route especially if it is used by a lot of packets to many different destination subnets can cause high processor utilization and a very large ARP cache along with attendant memory allocation failures3 With current configuration and cable connection ISP failover will not occur when you remove cable from switch to ISP because routers subint is still up So you need to use static route with SLA trackingWith IP SLA tracking router keep cheking if there is connectivity to your ISP default gateway and will failover to other ISP connection httpwwwciscocomenUStechtk648tk361technologiesconfigurationexample09186a00808d2b72shtml In above example it assumed that one ISP connection is dhcpIn you configuration you are using two static default

Static Route IP SLA Tracking with Delayed RIB Installation,Hi all Have the following task We need to track branchs local ISP and if its unrachable then failover to regional ISP which is available via MPLSBGP Task is quite simple if not one of its requirements which I am not sure how to meet It says  if local ISP fails and is down for 5 minutes failover to regional ISP but do not failback SOONER than 15 minutes to avoid flapping So generally speaking failover  failback is not so hard to achieve with IP SLA and tracking but tracking feature support delayed timers of 0 to 180seconds which is way below of what I need Has anyone faced the same task and how was it resolved Heres a basic configSome will say that using 8888 is not perfect and its better to use IP address from ISP1s range but ignore it At this moment in time we havent decided what to ping in outside world to track the liveliness of the service Defo not ISPs gateway but something more external In any case static permanent route to 8888 ensures it will ALWAYS go via ISP1 8888 is not an important resource from a corporate user perspective so that will do the trick The line in red bold is my biggest concern at the moment 3 minutes failover and failback is not what my requirements say This is Cat3850 running 374E,Hello I have copied IP sla and tracking configuration from your post but not using any preconfigured default routes and just have a static route for 888832 pointing towards the primary link I am using eem script to inject and withdraw default routes based on tracking status up or down If track is up then eem script will install the primary default routes and if down then it will remove the primary default route and install back up default route Failover to back up and failback to primary link is set to 5 minutes 300 seconds I tested this configuration in GNS3 and worked fine if you try debugging event manager in gns3 it may crash the IOS Be patient with the failover and failback because 5

and then mark it as an acceptable solution if it does it the way I need  Appreciate your time RVCE Your very welcome I hope it works out for you RVCE Right First of all thanks for those two applets helped me to look in the right direction I did few tests in my LIVE lab ie real kit and found the following  Cat9k or Cat3850s do not support EOT events enhanced object tracking so your applets cannot be used in my environment I didnt give up though and after a number of different versions I ended up with the following applet which works GREAT and does exactly what I need  Permanent static route to 8888 forces IP SLA object to always  my main ISP no matter what  this destination will be changed in live environment ip route 8888 255255255255 Po1 10180018 permanent  This is defaultpreferrable gateway into Internet but it requires HA ip route 0000 0000 Po1 10180018  ip sla 99 icmpecho 8888 sourceinterface Loopback180 frequency 30 ip sla schedule 99 life forever starttime now ip sla reactionconfiguration 99 react timeout thresholdtype consecutive 10 actiontype triggerOnly ip sla enable reactionalerts  I use this TRACK object as my global BOOLEAN variable see below track 99 stubobject  event manager environment qt   event manager applet trackroute authorization bypass event tag 10 ipsla operationid 99 reactiontype timeout action 001 cli command enable action 002 cli command config t  This block is executed when IP SLA triggers timeout event action 010 if ipslacondition eq Occurred action 011 track read 99 action 012 if trackstate eq down action 013 cli command no ip route 0000 0000 Po1 10180018 action 015 else action 016 cli command no event manager applet trackrouteup action 017 end action 018 track set 99 state down  This block is executed when IP SLA triggers UpRecovery event action 020 else action 021 track set 99 state up action 022 cli command event manager applet trackrouteup authorization bypass action 023 cli command  event timer countdown

command  action 13 cli command qt ip route 0000 0000 Po1 10180018 qt action 029 cli command  action 14 cli command qt no event manager applet trackrouteup qt action 040 end So heres the explanation how it works The moment 8888 becomes unreachable IP SLA begins to collect statistics for its trigger which is configured to trigger alert when 10 consecutive echos return timeout code For my lab I have configured 30s frequency for ICMP echoes so theoretically this can trigger alarm within 300s 5m This can be of course changed to xOfy to detect flapping conditions Anyway in 300s if link is down as per IP SLA then applet is being executed It checks the value of my global BOOLEAN variable and for this I use a STUB trcking object which is created with default DOWN value I use it as false I treat this value as IF its TRUE then link UP applet has been dynamically created in CLI and is awaiting for execution when timer expires so when IP SLA is triggered and this variable is FALSE then it means I am safe to instantly DELETE the static route which is done by the applet and then it stops Once IP SLA detects first successful ECHO it triggers another alert and my master applet is executed but this time it runs through a second block top level else condition which simply sets my global BOOLEAN variable to TRUE telling my future instances of the applet that I am in the proccess of recovery and creates a child applet which is executed with 600s delay 10m If nothing changes from IP SLA perspective within 600s then child applet is executed to reinstall my static route it also resets BOOLEAN to false again because I am not in recovery mode anymore If however link is flapping ie IP SLA triggers another timeout alarmevent then master applet is executed first IF condition is matched Occured but here an interesting thing happens I check if my TRACK object or my BOOLEAN is true If it is it means I am already in recovery mode but link flaps so I have to stop this recovery mode by deleting my child applet  Ive done few cycles of tests and it works perfectly fine but I might be able to find few more things before it goes live I am quite satisfied with myself D Thanks again RVCE Good to know that you came up with an applet that works for your environment Thanks for sharing the script and explaining how the script works

Segment contains a list of ASNs encoded as twobytelong numbers and then the next segment if any follows Notice above that this ASPATH claims to start with an ASSEQUENCE segment type with 2 ASNs inside but the first ASN makes no sense  it is 0 The second ASN is 20940 and here the first segment ends Following should be another segment but its encoding makes no sense  its segment type is invalid its length is invalid and the remaining bytes cannot be interpreted It actually seems that your BGP peer is mistakenly expressing the AS numbers in 4Blong format instead of 2B If we assume this interpretation then it suddenly makes starting sense 40 02  Transitive ASPATH 0A  Length 10 02  Segment Type ASSEQUENCE 02  Segment Length 2 ASNs 000051CC 000040F1  Segment 20940 16625 A wellbehaved BGP speaker should however never do this In an ASPATH the ASNs must be 2Blong values For 4Blong values another attribute the AS4PATH must be used but this attribute was not present in that message at all Using 4Blong ASNs in an ASPATH is definitely a gross violation of the BGP protocol specification as the receiving peer assumes that the ASNs are in 2B format and decodes them differently as shown previously My suspicion is also corroborated by the AGGREGATOR attribute C0 07  Optional Transitive Aggregator 08  Length 8 should have been 6 0000 51CC  Probably ASN 20940 172D 4359  Probably IP 23456789 BGP specification in RFC 4271 states very clearly that the Aggregator is a 6byte attribute consisting of the ASN that formed the aggregate route and the IP address of the router that formed the aggregate route However as you can see above this attribute is 8 not 6 bytes long and the difference is again in the ASN encoding where the AS 20940 seems to be encoded as an 4B value Definitely there is nothing you can do on your part about this It seems that the BGP implementation of your peer is broken and it has to be corected in the code Please have the administrator of your BGP peer see this post and contact the support for his router Definitely this will require patching the operating system or the BGP daemon of your peer which is something only a vendor can do Just wondering  what vendor and operating system is used on the misbehaving BGP peer Best regardsPeter RVCE Hi Peter Ive compared both working and non working BGP peer Please see attached debug results Not working  refer to sessiontxtWorking  refer to sessionseatxt RVCE JosiahIve had a look at the debugs you have posted Those debugs describe the OPEN and KEEPALIVE messages being exchanged and the NOTIFICATION being sent between routers when something goes gravely wrong but these messages do not include UPDATE messages I would believe that you need to use debug bgp update command to activate debugs of UPDATE messagesHowever I do not believe we will find anything new The analysis of the malformed message clearly shows that the misbehaving BGP peer is sending autonomous system numbers in 4B format in attributes where only 2B numbers are expected As I indicated before this is not a problem on your device It is the problem of the BGP peer and there is literally nothing you can do Its a buggy BGP implementation on the misbehaving BGP peer and it is up to its administrator to find out if there are any updates to the operating system he is usingBest regardsPeter RVCE Peter Let me clarify this on my peer Ill get back as soon as I already have an update Thank you for your assistance RVCE Hi JosiahCertainly Please keep me updated  this issue is very interesting and I would like to know your peers response Please have him read this thread as it contains important diagnostic informationLooking forward to hearing from youBest regardsPeter RVCE JosiahI have to correct myself somewhat According to RFC 4893 and its updated version RFC 6973 if both neighbors agree on using 4byte ASNs then all ASNs will be expressed in 4byte format including those in ASPATH and this would be a correct behaviorSo now the questions boil down toDid your two routers truly negotiate and agree on the use of 4byte ASNsIf so why is your router having a problem with them now that it should be accepting themWould it be possible for you to post the sanitized configuration of your BGP process from your router Also can you please post the output of show bgp neighbor 20642721Thank you  and apologies for

advertising the 4byte ASN capability to the problematic peer This should at least allow the session to come up and remain stable even though the 4byte ASN capability will be disabled Lets consider this to be just a workaround to find out if removing the 4byte ASN capability will solve the problem If so we will discuss the options further router bgp AS neighbor 20641721 capability suppress

Filter Multicast Traffic,Hello Everyone In the Network we are currently using Multicast for the cameras connected as below ref The multicast traffic from each and every camera reaching all the Uplink of the L3 SwitchesIE4000 which is increasing exponentiallySimplified Connectivity How to Filter the Multicast traffic from all the L3 Switches Except RPDC RouterMulticast is configured in PIM Sparse mode I can able to filter the PIM neighbors using PIM ACL filter But still the same traffic is reflecting on all connected interfaces How can I filter the traffic any solutions available for this,Hello I am not sure I understand what you are asking you want to prevent all multicast traffic to all ports except the uplink ports to the DC router  If that is what you are asking you could configure the below on all ports except the uplink ports stormcontrol multicast level 00 This effectively suppresses all multicast traffic RVCE Hello Georg Pauwen Thank you for your valuable suggestions Exactly I want to filter the Multicast Traffic from the cameras to all the interfaces except DC interafce FYI I have already configured the stormcontrol level multicast level 5 but no traffic is getting filtered In this case OSPF is used for Internal routing  I have a doubt that If I change this Level to 0 it will block all the multicast traffic including OSPF packets 224005  224006 RVCE Hello in OSPF use the neighbor command to use unicast in stead of multicast to establish the neighborships Either way if you use the storm control multicast command only on the interfaces that do not uplink to the router you should be fine The level needs to be 00 a level of 5 still means 5 percent of the bandwidth can be used for multicast
Connect 2 redundant routers to 1 firewall or 2 switches to 1 router,So if I have two redundant routers running HSRP would I be able to connect them to 1 ASA5585XWould I give the FW interface connecting to Router 1 lets say nameif insidegive the other FW interface connecting to Router 2 nameif inside 2then be able to apply the same ACL to both interfaces But then how would I point both routers to 1 ip address on the FW if this actually can work I have same question in regards to 2 switches connecting to 1 router and the switches point to same lets say 1 address on the router,Hi A solution in order to have 2 routers connected to the firewall is  User HSRP between 2 routers creating a virtual IP  Connect the routers and firewall using a switch and using one VLAN and the same network for example a network 29 for all the devices example R1 10002 R2 10003 HSRP virtual on Routers 10001 and on the firewall 10004 everything 29  Routers will use different priorities and their next hop will be the IP configured on the firewall  The firewall will have 1 next hop to the internal network and the IP used as next hop will be the virtual IP of the HSRP With this you will have just one inside nameif and you will not duplicate ACLs Take in consideration the firewall is a point of failure if it is possible by budget is create a cluster of firewall and for the switch create a stack of 2 switches or 2 standalone switches Hope it is useful  RVCE Ok can you take a look at the diagram I made real quick Lets say I have 2 routers I can use to connect to the FW Would it work the way I am showing I guess since I have 2 connections to the FW I would have 2 identical inside nameif RVCE Hi Usually this scheme is with 2 firewalls one connected to each switch now you could enable port channel on the ASA but my suggestion is install a stack of switch instead of stand alone switches  RVCE I would stick a layer 2 device between the firewall and the two routers so that your ASAs outside interface connects to both routers with a switch in the middle Please remember to rate useful posts by clicking on the stars below RVCE What if I had 2 additional switches for redundancy to connect to one FW would this work Would the FW allow me to make two identical inside nameif Please see diagram RVCE Ok Please take a look at this diagram My connections seem right RVCE Hi That scheme will work but you will have 2 point of failure the switch and the firewall RVCE Ok yes ideally I would have 2 of everything up to the edge router If I have switches connecting to each router for redundancy I cant use the same subnets on each router port connection for each Sw meaning how would I configure the connecting ports on the routers The routers would be configured for HSRP and the interface that connects to each switch would have the subinterfaces for routing all the subnets If AccSw1 is connected to InternalRt1 g1 G1 has 10001 g12 10021 g13 10031 etc how would I configure the port on InternalRt1 that connects to AccSw2 Vice versa for AccSw to InternalRt2 Please see diagram I updated showing the redundant connections RVCE Hi In order to connect the routers and firewall to the switch is using the same VLAN for example Router 1  Switch1  trunk  Router 2  Switch2 ROUTER1 interface g00 description TOISP ip address 1012302 255255255248 standby 10 ip 1012301 standby 10

things still So on the g00 interfaces on the routers you referring to the connection that goes to the Edge Sw Interconnecting Sw and are you giving an example as if I had 2 EdgeInterconnect switches In regards to the Access switches I cant connect each switch to each router as well given I cant put the same IPs on each port on the routers that is used to connect to each switch correct RVCE Also it is probably best to use a management Vlan for the ports on the interconnecting switch in order to give all devices IPs in the management vlan correct RVCE Also the ports on the routers g2 that connect to the Interconnecting switch how would I configure them if the interconnecting switch is just for vlan access 123 I know I would configure HSRP interfaces on g1 of the router but what about g2 interfaces that connect to the other switches each access switch connects to each router Please take a look at the diagram as I updated it to help clarify RVCE Ok so there is no way to connect both redundant routers to 1 FW right meaning the FW would need to of the same inside interfaces I guess right Also I can get the interfonnect switch to ping the router via trunk connection but can only get the switch to ping the FW if I put the connecting interface in switcport access vlan 10 which is same subnet as inside interface on FW My concern is if all internal subnets on the LAN will be able to pass through the interconnect switch and on out to the internet See attached diagram Any help is appreciated RVCE Ok so there is no way to connect both redundant routers to 1 FW right meaning the FW

How to configure the BGP conditional advertisement feature,Hello Everyone i am a service deliver engineer and having a project to deliver for my own organization Scenario,There is a feature in BGP that can be used for conditional advertisement Below are the featuresoptions that can be used for conditional advertisement advertisemap nonexistmap existmap  injectmap These features work in conjunction and the logic is just like if and else in programming For example only advertise network A to ISP x when network B is available in bgp rib or vice versa RVCE Thanks buddy I will try this and let you know One question here is there any chance for collision with pbr applied on local router interface RVCE Hi Correct me if I am wrong but based on your explanation it appears you have a PBR thats doing load balancing between 2 WAN circuits for your internal subnets going out to internet if thats the case then when a circuit goes down then you lose your next ip hop and PBR becomes invalid at that time and router will route packets based on global RIB For this you dont need any conditional advertisement unless you are receiving specific routes from your ISP or if you are advertising prefixes to your ISPs but if you just have default routes just to access internet then you shouldnt need any of this RVCE The title of the original post is pretty clear in suggesting that they are looking for conditional advertisement And so the response explaining about conditional advertisement is appropriate But as I read the original post I believe that conditional advertisement is not what they are really looking for The original post describes setting up PBR to separate traffic being sent to their two ISP and asks for a solution to provide failover if one ISP has problems and would send that traffic to the other ISP Would conditional advertising help do that If you think about it using PBR controls how they send traffic to the ISP And conditional advertisement controls what they advertise to the ISP and therefore controls how the ISP sends traffic to them And that does not provide the failover for PBR I would suggest that what they are looking to achieve in reacting to a failure and sending traffic to the other ISP can be achieved using the verifyavailability parameter in the PBR set ip nexthop command and perhaps some floating static routes HTH Rick

need it but you dont have any static routes in your first post and you dont need any The reason you dont have connectivity to 5555 from Core RT or RR1 because they are in the AS 400 and 5555 also originates from AS 400 this is a loop prevention mechanism used by BGP when a BGP speaking router receives a prefix that includes its own AS in the AS PATH it wont accept it So MGGS1RR1 wont accept any prefix advertised by Core RT or RR1 and vice versa There are two ways to resolve this issue and I am sharing the one that I used On RR1 use this command router bgp 400 neighbor 1010201 allowasin On MGGS1RR1 use this command router bgp 400 neighbor 1010402 allowasin  After making all these changes I was able to ping 5555 from loop back 0 of core RT CoreRTping 5555 source loop 0 repeat 1000Type

HELP NAT translation time out optimization,Hi guys I need some of your opinions on how to optimize our nat translations time out First of all heres the current config we have ip nat translation timeout 10800ip nat translation tcptimeout 10800ip nat translation udptimeout 360ip nat translation dnstimeout 40 public IPs allocated 64approximate number of translations during peak hours 250000 Issues were encountering1 We are just on 250K translations entry yet the pool allocation shows always 100 I understand theres some nonpattable protocols we will modify our ACL soon 2 Some users are having a hard time establishing a stable session with some AWS sites Webhosting sites Cpanel What Im seeing in the translation table is that theres always multiple translation entry to a single user with different inside global public IPs addresses which could break their existing tcp session with those services mentioned above as some of them are very strict in terms of source ips when youve logged in Users are actually getting error messages Your IP address has changed please log in again Any recommendations guys,Hello what platform eg ISR 4321 is this on and which IOS version are you running  Post your config we might spot something RVCE We got it sorted by enabling PAP or pairedaddresspooling feature 
Redistribute Static to EIGRP with lower Metric,Hi EverybodyAll our remotes sites are connected to our main datacenter via MPLS IPVPN and for one of these remote sites we had an additional ADSL connection installed for resiliency And an IPSEC tunnel has being configured between remote and head office ASA Have disabled RR on both ends Redistribute Static configured on the head office FW to EIGRP Manually added a static route with a higher AD So once the MPLS connection goes down and IPSEC tunnel is formed So no issues However when the primary connection comes back EIGRP doesnt switch back to the MPLS route but prefers the IPSEC path due to a lower metric that gets redistributed to the core with an AD of 170I know there are a few options like offset lists redistribute the static with a metric or a route mapThe config will need to be made on the HO firewall so what would be the preferred choice Any advice would be much appreciated,Hi My suggestion is use IP SLA to be monitoring the connectivity to MPLS once it is up an EEM script could be executed automatically in order to modify the static route metrics to set up them with higher Hope it is useful  RVCE Thanks Julio this is something we havent though of the scripting side Would there be any reference from Cisco regarding this method as I am fairly new to this field and havent done any EEM scripts on live environments RVCE Hi There is information about EEM on the Cisco Website now I could share an example imagining your scenario
NAT on a stick with CSR 1000v on Amazon,Hi I would like to set up NAT on a stick How can I do it on CSR 1000v Any working examples would be good policy routemap command is what people have commonly use to NAT traffic based on destination However the command is not available on CSR1000v what can I do about it ,Why would you want to do that when everything leaving and entering via the Internet is already NATed for you by Amazon RVCE I am using CSR 1000v on Amazon to establish IPSEC VPN tunnels with remote VPN partners Some may require us to perform source NATing prior to sending it through the tunnel Any advice on how I can do that  RVCE You may be able to use FlexVPN and VTIs That would provide you with interfaces to do NAT That would be my first choice Failing that a nasty trick that may work never tried it myself  create two loop back interfaces Build a GRE tunnel from one loopback to another loopback Then you can statically route traffic into the GRE tunnel  which will come straight back to you and use a routemap to do the final forward That would let you use ip nat inside and ip nat outside Another thought going through my mind is to create an extra vrf outside put one loopback into the outside vrf and then build you GRE tunnel between the inside and outside vrfs That will give you two completely seperate routing tables and you wont need any policy routing You could also explore doing vrf NAT which does not require an ip nat inside or ip nat outside You can also do vrf nat within a vrf Check out the ip nat enable command and vrf NAT RVCE I have similar requirement and I want NAT traffic on AWS transit VPC CSR router so if anyone tested this NAT setup then please be inform working solution RVCE Anyone able to advise on this  RVCE Just putting a note here for anybody looking for the solution For reference NAT with crypto map and other restrictions is not supported for CSR on AWS  httpwwwciscocomcenustddocsrouterscsr1000softwareawscsrawsawsoverviewpdf The workaround is to create vrf for NAT operation and run VASI between global and VRF Traffic from inside local must be PBRs into VASI to reach VRF Diagram  vasiright200  CSR1000v   vrf X     vasileft200  vasiright100      CSR1000v   Global RIB  vasileft100   physical interface   AWS cloud   VRF partinterface vasiright100 vrf for X ip address 10012 255255255252 no ip unreach no ip redi ip nat inside  interface vasiright200 vrf for X ip address 10022 255255255252 no ip unreach no ip redi ip nat outside  ip route vrf X inside local 255255255255 vasiright100 ip route vrf X 0000 0000 vasiright200 ip nat inside source static inside local inside global vrf X matchinvrfip route inside global 255255255255 vasileft200 For complex designs you may run BGP between VRFs over VASI interfaces RVCE Does the No NAT with crypto limitation apply only in this NAT on a Stick situation The document states You cannot apply NAT PAT on the same interface that is configured with a crypto map but in my case I have a second interface which is my nat inside I have AWS VPCs X and Y connected to my VPC As CSR 1000v via IPSECAWS VPN Gateway and I would like to have all traffic destined for the internet from VPC X and Y go through the 1000V in VPC A Is this possible
Replacing a discontinued SNA solution  advice appreciated,Hi  Im new here so please excuse me if Im not quite in the right place or not doing this quite rightFor background I have over 40 years computer experience but little or none of it in Comms We have a current SNA solution that communicates between an HP3000 computer in one location in the UK for which I am SysAdmin and an IBM computer in another UK location over 100 miles away This solution uses Cisco routers linked via a pair of dedicated ISDN lines But our comms supplier for this solution has announced it will be discontinued at the end of October 2018 so we need to seek an alternative approach As the HP3000 is old technology our options to change anything on it or add anything are limited to nonexistent eg no prospect of using say Enterprise Extender on it So we need a downstream box that will accept the SNA over serial cables and replace the existing downstream hardware And probably the same at the other end though there may be more flexibility there One change we could make is to output our SNA over SDLC rather than the currently X25 But our supplier will no longer support either nor the DLSw used over these lines We are not wedded to the leased ISDN lines which we recognise as old technology and would prefer to use the WAN over which much traffic already flows between these two sites though from other servers we operate This WAN is operated by a different comms supplier from the one mentioned above I am told though my understanding is sketchy that the link at the IBM end needs to appear at Level 2 I continue to suspect that there is Cisco equipment we could use for this though not the existing routers which anyway belong to the comms supplier Any advice will be welcomed,

High Egress Surge on Transit router external Interface,1 First Network topologyInternetG00 TRCoreSWFirewall Server and LAN network Gateway Customers 2 Problem is at the G00 port on TR specially the Egress  Surges to 200 Mbps3 We are using NPM so we can see the DLUL utilization on each port and all are below 10 Mbps4 When Checking the TR webuiport G00egress I find the top usage from unknown and Domain name system5 What is that  Unknown  or how to know it  How to stop such surges or at least to know Why it happens so i can deal with it taking into consideration that this surge happens in 1 hour intervals any time in the day  peak hours or off hours like 3 am6 Its only the upload and its from the TR only which is weird for me I will attach a snap shot from the Webui We are using simple QoS but nothing was happening for the last few monthsthat just happened 2 days ago and its back to normal right now,So after doing a packet capture we found out that out bandwidth was being used through port 17 from an ip thats not in out network We applied an ACL for both egress and ingress blocking port 17 on our port and problem is solved

PFRv3 When adding pathid to external interfaces of Hub BR branch BR doesnt create channels,Hi everyone I have a simple setup of two ASR1001x with 1663 software The first ASR is both Hub MC and Hub BR and the second ASR is Branch MC and Branch BR They are connected by two tunnels over the same physical interface although for debugging purposes Im using a single tunnel at present 1 When the Hub MCs tunnels are configured with domain IWAN path SP1 PFRv3 works just fine However when I instead configure domain IWAN path SP1 pathid 1 the Branch BR doesnt create any channels On the Branch BR when I perform a show domain IWAN master channels or show domain IWAN border channels it comes up empty Moreover when I check for parent routes using show domain IWAN border parent route it also comes up empty Ive configured domain IWAN dynamicpath on the Branch BR but that didnt solve the problem When performing show platform hardware qfp active feature pfrv3 datapath global on the Branch BR the drop tag conflict counter increases steadily during this scenario When I configure the Hub BR without a pathid then drop tag conflict doesnt increment at all 2 I read in the release notes for IWAN 221 that In IWAN POP a PfR master controller and a PfR border router must be configured in different devices Any chance thats related to the issue If not what limitations would likely be seen if a continue to use my Hub MC as a BR Edit 1 Tried separating Hub MC from Hub BR the issue remains Thanks for your time,Hello Can you make sure that you are not using the same path id  same hub location Best Regards RVCE Hi Ive changed by topology quite a bit in the past weeks but as I recall things began to work as expected once I used different pathids in the same hubtransit I used the same pathid in both Hub and Site but not within the same site So your suggestion may have been what was missing at the time Any idea what would happen if I were to use different pathids for each of the tunnels across both hub and transit Meaning no pathid is the same across all my interfaces at the core sites Would it make the transit site not operate as designed Thanks
PFRv3 Traffic classes dont preempt back to active routes by EIGRP metric,Hi everyone I have a dual HUB PFRv3 setup with a number of spokes The WAN transport protocol is EIGRP The routers are ASR1001xs with the latest code 1663 Master Hub is Hub A H1 Transit site is Hub B H2 Each have two BRsThere are two spoke sites each with two BRs Spoke A S1 and Spoke B S2Each are connected to the dual hubs EIGRP metricwise H1 is the preferred path for all traffic from the spokes It is only when H1 has no active connections to the spoke does a spoke communicate via H2 This is done via changing the delays of the tunnels and cross interfaces between BRs at the Hubs and Spokes When traffic from S1 is destined to S2 when both H1 and H2 are available it flows like this S1  H1  S2 During failover testing I disconnected S1 from H1 The traffic then flows like thisS1  H2  S2 So far so good However when I return the connection between S1 and H1 the traffic classes continue to use H2 as their datapath It is only when I clear the trafficclasses at S1 that the TCs learn to use H1 as their Hub I checked the routing table including the PFR overrides H1 is recognized as the preferred route However the trafficclasses never preempt back from H2 to H1 Any ideas how this can be resolved even if using a timer Thanks,Can you show the trafficclasses for the flow you are taking about If you can also send your domain configuration it would make it easier to understand show run  sec domain With iWAN your delay configuration on EIGRP may not mean much the EIGRP routes are there more to make sure you have a parent route on the BR so it will be able to generate probes on the link They way your traffic will be handled is based on the policies you have defined so lets say you have it configured for MPLS link and then the INET link You probably have INET for both H1 and H2 so even when EIGRP shows a better metric to INET on H1 compared to MPLS to H2 iWAN will route that traffic to H2 There are multiple ways to configure iWAN so I not going to comment much about them here I think first we need to understand exactly how it is working now and how you want it to work We can then think of configuring different Path names or PathIDs on H1H2 RVCE Hi Sorry for the delayed reply Ill examine this issue shortly some other issues are taking up my time at the moment I was wondering do you have any idea if Spoke to Spoke PFRv3 is supported I havent found any documentation to suggest that PFRv3 works as designed between spoke to spoke only spoke to hub or transit

Unable to hit outside interface from outside  Cisco ISR4400,In my current setup I have an ISR4400 directly connected to the ISP I am able to connect to the internet from the inside and ping any public IP as well as the outside interface IP However I can not ping the outside interface from an outside IP I am able to ping the next hop router from outside as well I have created inside  outside zones and applied the relevant policy and class maps I also created policies and maps and pairs for the self zone as a test in case for some reason the router was not doing the default behaviour For now my classmap refers to an ACL that only allows ICMP from outside to inside I saw on another thread about adding a route to the outside interfaceis this the issue If so where is it added as I was unable to add a route outside Thanks in advance orangeshow runningconfig Building configurationCurrent configuration  4014 bytes Last configuration change at 121121 UTC Mon Apr 16 2018 by xxxversion 155service

httpswwwciscocomcenussupportdocssecurityiosfirewall98628zonedesignguidehtmlaccesscontrol Let me know if it helps RVCE your inspect lists are not the same as accesslist you need an access list on your outside interface to allow icmp as well Please remember to rate useful posts by clicking on the stars below RVCE There are no ACL on the outside interface so everything should be allowed RVCE I would put one in and maybe do a permit any any or a specific permit icmp from your IP address you are pinging from so you can at least confirm if the pings are hitting your outside interface Please remember to rate useful posts by clicking on the stars below RVCE Yes good ideaConfigure an ACL on the outside interface that allows ICMP with the log statement and rememeber to allow ip any as wellOr maybe do a debug ip packets with an ACL that only allows ICMP Be carefull if this is a production environment RVCE Thank you all for the replies so far I got frustrated so just wiped the config I have left the

Setting up ISR 4431  WAN Issues,HiIm hoping someone here can help Ill start off by saying that my Cisco knowledge is minimal though Id say my general networking knowledge is good My employer currently uses a Nomadix gateway router to manage their incoming connection The main link is a commercial grade IP link with a number of fixed IP addresses Theyve purchased a Cisco ISR 4431 as a replacement for the Nomadix and asked me to configure it All theyve given me is the IP address subnet broadcast IP and gateway IP from the ISP Ive configured GE000 as a management port to access the GUI and then done the following  Configured GE001 as a WAN port using the IP address and subnet provided by the provider Configured GE002 as a LAN port with a static IP of 101011 and subnet of 2552552550 Configured a DHCP scope on range 101010 with DNS servers specified by the provider If I use the troubleshooting section in the GUI I can ping 8888 through the WAN interface and if I connect a client device to GE002 it picks up an IP address via DHCP but no Internet access I can ping the LAN interface and WAN interface from my device but nothing else Weirdly if I configure the WAN interface to receive config via DHCP and then connect it to the LAN side of the Nomadix everything works The provider are certain the details are correct which seems to be bourn out by the fact I can ping 8888 Im confused as to what to do with the broadcast and gateway addresses from the provider There doesnt seem to be any way for me to enter this information into the 4431s config, Since you mentioned that you are able to ping 8888 from your router then we can say that most likely you have a default route installed on your router Since the dhcp scope 10101024 you are using is a private range and not routable over the internet you would need to NAT it to the public address assigned by the ISP You dont do anything with the broadcast address but gateway is used to route packets to unknown destination Are you running any routing protocol between your router and ISPs router You could have used gateway address provided by the ISP if you were not receiving a default route by the provider ip route 0000 0000 xxxx xxxx is gateway or next hop To check if you have a default route installed on your router  run this command  sh ip route and you should have an output like below and gateway of last resort should match the gateway address provided by the ISP which should be the IP address assigned to ISPs WAN interface Gateway of last resort is 1010302 to network 0000 S 00000 10 via 1010302 RVCE Many thanks for the reply I follow what youre saying I understand about publicprivate ranges and Ive turned NAT on on both interfaces Wherehow can I add the gateway address so that traffic is routed correctly I was leaning toward that being the problem but I was unsure how to proceed I assume ip route 0000 0000 xxxx is a terminal command If I understand 0000 0000 is basically everything Apologies if these are stupid questions Im not a Cisco guy though I am looking at starting CCNA next year in tandem with an IT degree RVCE You understanding is correct Would you be able to provide routing table from the router cant navigate you how to get it using GUI since I have never used GUI to manage a router but if you can telnet or ssh then you can use sh ip route But I am wondering how you would you be able to ping 8888 if you didnt have a default route on the router or unless you just had a static route for 888832 but who would put it there if you didnt configure it RVCE Hi heres the IP info from my provider IP Pool 14142214429 Network IP 141422144 Gateway 141422145 The IP allocated for this router 141422147 Subnet 255255255248 Hi here is the output from sh ip route Gateway of last resort is 141422145 to network 0000 S 00000 10 via 141422145 100008 is variably subnetted 2 subnets 2 masksC 10101024 is directly connected GigabitEthernet002L 10101132 is directly connected GigabitEthernet002 140008 is variably subnetted 2 subnets 2 masksC 14142214429 is directly connected GigabitEthernet001L 14142214732 is directly connected GigabitEthernet001 So if I understand correctly the WAN port GE001 can at least see the providers router 14144 When I said I could ping 8888 I meant from GE001 through the GUI I cant ping 8888 LAN side I just noticed that my DHCP setup isnt dishing out a default gateway could this be the problem RVCE Yes user machines need to have default gateway of 101011 which is your routers Lan interface for a quick test you can assign a static ip from the pool range to one of the machines with a default gateway and also the DNS servers and then try accessing internet and pinging that ip address  RVCE Thanks I didnt get much time today to check things but it looks like the problem is with NAT I spoke to one of our head office network engineers and he said it definitely sounds like it Ive sent the config to him and hes going to check it over and get back to me Thank you very much for your help though its been very much appreciated RVCE As you can ping from WAN interface is sounds like NAT outbound please paste show run from CLI and make sure your NAT overload ACL and configuration is referencing the correct interfaces httpswwwciscocomcenussupportdocslongreachethernetlredigitalsubscriberlinexdslasymmetricdigitalsubscriberlineadsl12905827spathtml
Newbie Question,Afternoon folks just wondered if someone could help I have a layer 2 service between two routers and want to create a new VLAN 21 at one end Head Office The other end is our internet breakout and want to send any VPN traffic for anything on that VLAN to the head office router through the internet router I have current static routes in place for the primary LAN so my question is can I add a new route and send traffic down that current virtual interface or do i have to have a virtual int on the same VLAN at both ends Cheers in advance,

Q1  2 Router and a Switch,Hi All I am a newbie who has picked Networking just Last Week for career change mostly reading on my own I have few very basic questions which I would like your help with These may seem stupid to learned ones but please bear with me I am putting my first question in this forum where I am trying to understand how the traffic flow between 2 routers connected via switch I am not looking for any readymade answer hence I have put my understanding for you all to correctamend Thanks in advance Let’s assume I have two routers connected via switch as  Router 1  Switch 1  Router 2 Service Provider Network Situation 1  Both Routers are on same subnet say 200101024 and no VLAN defined on switchSteps  Question  If there are multiple switch connected to R1 is there any routing need to be defined in R1 to send the packet for R2 via S1 I believe there should at least be a routing for R2 IP in R1 Situation 2  Both Routers are on different subnet R1  200101024 R2  200102024 and no VLAN on switchSteps – No difference from Situation1 Situation 3  Both Routers are on samedifferent subnet and they are on different VLANs VLAN 10 – R1 and VLAN 20R2Steps – Hopefully this should clear out my understanding of basic routing RegardsJRS Solved Go to Solution,Hello Situation 1 Whether or not there are one or more switches between R1  R2 if they are on the same subnet and a common VLAN they should be able to reach each other without any routing protocol Situation 2 If the routers are on different subnets on a common VLAN there may be some erroneous communication due to the fact that theyll see each others broadcasts However you wont be able establish routing between the two Situation 3 The only ARPiing that will occur is the routers will ARP the switch for the respective L3 VLAN IP MACs Once the routers have this information any packets that need to go to the other subnet will have the destination IP of the other subnet host with the destination MAC address of the switchs VLAN interface Hope this helps happy networking RVCE Hello Situation 1 Whether or not there are one or more switches between R1  R2 if they are on the same subnet and a common VLAN they should be able to reach each other without any routing protocol Situation 2 If the routers are on different subnets on a common VLAN there may be some erroneous communication due to the fact that theyll see each others broadcasts However you wont be able establish routing between the two Situation 3 The only ARPiing that will occur is the routers will ARP the switch for the respective L3 VLAN IP MACs Once the routers have this information any packets that need to go to the other subnet will have the destination IP of the other subnet host with the destination MAC address of the switchs VLAN interface Hope this helps happy networking RVCE Thanks Chrihussey looks like I was almost there and then missed it Can you help me with some more clarifications around your response They are inline to your reply Thanks in advance chrihussey wrote Hello Situation 1 Whether or not there are one or more switches between R1  R2 if they are on the same subnet and a common VLAN they should be able to reach each other without any routing protocol JRS Was I correct in the steps part Also If there are more than one switch directly connected to R1 how will R1 know which switch to send the packet 2 to reach R2 Situation 2 If the routers are on different subnets on a common VLAN there may be some erroneous communication due to the fact that theyll see each others broadcasts However you wont be able establish routing between the two JRS Although this is a fictitious scenario what is the way to overcome this and establish the routing Situation 3 The only ARPiing that will occur is the routers will ARP the switch for the respective L3 VLAN IP MACs Once the routers have this information any packets that need to go to the other subnet will have the destination IP of the other subnet host with the destination MAC address of the switchs VLAN interface JRS So do you mean only R1 will ARP to get S1s MAC Once the packet reaches S1 using R2 IP and S1 MAC how will S1 know the MAC of R2 for second leg of packet ie to R2 as there could be multiple host connected to switch in R2 subnet Hope this helps happy networking JRS Many Thanks RVCE JRS Was I correct in the steps part Also If there are more than one switch directly connected to R1 how will R1 know which switch to send the packet 2 to reach R2 Yes you were correct on the steps In the simplest terms a router cannot have two interfaces sharing the same network It primary function is to route packets So if a router is directly connected to more than one switch then the interfaces would belong to different networks or VLANs on the switches The routing configuration would determine which interface to use JRS Although this is a fictitious scenario what is the way to overcome this and establish the routing There are probably several ways but the easiest that comes to mind would be to give both routers a secondary IP so that each of the interfaces would have the IPs in both subnets This way they could communicate across a single VLAN with both networks Technically no routing required JRS So do you mean only R1 will ARP to get S1s MAC Once the packet reaches S1 using R2 IP and S1 MAC how will S1 know the MAC of R2 for second leg of packet ie to R2 as there could be multiple host connected to switch in R2 subnet So once the packet gets from R1 to S1 S1 then needs to route the packet to the other VLAN If S1 does not know the IPMAC of R2 then S1 will send an ARP request Once R2 replies S1 will forward the packet from R1 but change the MAC address in the L2 header to that of R2 In addition R2 will also learn the IPMAC combo of the S1 interface through this process to send return packets to R1 RVCE Thanks It clearer now I am yet to read about Secondary IP for make Situation 2 workFor Situation 3 does the response change if R1 and R2 are in same subnet I believe they shouldnt as they would still be in different VLAN RVCE If R1 and R2 are on he same subnet yet on different VLANs on the switch they will not communicate You cannot have the same network in two different places RVCE Thanks much I now have the clarity
interface errors and discards,Hi  we have several cisco devices deployed in network and using cisco prime to monitor these devices Can anybody tell me how prime is calculating input and output errorsdiscards And what is bad valuethreshold value for interface errorsdiscards,Value is against the total output packets vs the total output drop RVCE And what is bad valuethreshold value for interface errorsdiscardsFor errors you ideally would like to always have zero percent However Ethernet does have an acceptable by design bit error rate which I dont recall what it is but is a very smallFor discards again ideally you like to see a zero value However very generally speaking up to 1 is often considered acceptable but in some cases that can be too high even much too high Further discards tend to happen in bursts so a short term drop rate might be a much higher percentage which is often not visible over a longer term average often 5 minutesWhats an acceptable discard rate for one kind of traffic might be unacceptable for another kind of traffic Further discards impact can vary based on the overall RTT of TCP traffic

Call routes,I am new here and am not sure if this is the write forum for my questionWhat could be the issue when a Cisco router 4331 has a working call flow between the gateway and the PABX However as soon as the call routes to the phone am losing the traffic and there is no communication between the gateway and the phone and hence a oneway speech No packets are being received by the Phones from the gateway,This is very likely related to RTP traffic not being able to set up end to end most likely due to routing you would need to provide us with SIP debugs to see where the RTP is attempted to be terminated Please remember to rate useful posts by clicking on the stars below

3333 source 1111 and you will be able to ping because by default it will source the icmp packet from 1010101 and since NRR1 doesnt have a route back to 1010101 it will drop the packet RR1 doesnt have this issue because its directly connected to NRR1 Also not sure why you have static routes for loopbacks when you are advertising them through BGP You dont need to make any changes to the configuration that you posted to make this work RVCE Hello You are correct that when I pinged 3333 sourced from 1111 that I was able to see the echo reply without the need to change any configuration However when I tried to remove the static routes as suggested I was no longer able to ping The reason for the static routes to be there is to ensure that the remote peer address used for peering is reachable Thank you for your notes though RVCE what Georg suggested will work but then you would have to redistribute the static route under ospf that you have configured for 3333 on RR1 because RR1 wont install 333332 in bgp rib since you have a static route and therefore it wont be advertised to Core RT Another way of solving this puzzle is to increase the AD of static route for 333332 to 21 which is greater than ebgp AD of 20 and with that manipulation prefix 333024 will be installed in bgp rib of RR1 and advertised to Core RT through iBGP and OSPF through bgp redistribution Core RT will install prefix 333024 as an OSPF external route as AD of OSPF 110 is lower than iBGP AD of 200 I am sorry if its confusing my intention is show that there could be multiple work around but simplest solution is always the best If you simply use the directly connected interface address for ebgp peering and not loopback loopback is beneficial for ebgp peering if you have redundant links between two ebgp neighbors then you wont need any static routes on any router and just mutual redistribution will work as George suggested But if you dont want to do that then above method will work which is redistribution of static route for 333332 on RR1 under the ospf process and you can remove all static routes from RT on R1 you will only need 1 static route for 333324 and same goes for NRR1 just 1 static route for RR1 loopback address I hope this helps RVCE Hello Thanks for your suggestions I changed the AD of the static route on RR1 to 21 as suggested and noticed that the 3333 route shows as EBGP route on RR1 when I did the show ip route command The issue is when I went back to CoreRT and tried to do an extended ping 1000 pings to 3333 on NRR1 the echo replies were intermittent It dropped after around 700 pings I had to do a clear ip route  for the ping to resume and complete I also noticed that the BGP5ADJCHANGE notification periodically appeared on the Consoles of both RR1 and NRR1 It looks like BGP was flapping What do I need to do to correct both the intermittent ping and the BGP flapping Thanks again RVCE Behavior that you are seeing is correct By increasing AD of static route on RR1 it is creating a chicken and egg situation because you are relying on static route for ebgp peering The only way I can think of fixing this is to either redistribute static which was recommended earlier or use directly connected interfaces for ebgp peering and with that you can get rid of all static routes which was also suggested before RVCE tag RVCE tag RVCE Hello for the sake of simplicity I would include all loopback interfaces in AS400 in the OSPF process and get rid of all static routes except for the two between RR1 and NRR1 in order to establish the EBGP neighbors Then perform mutual BGPOSPF redistribution on RR1 only RVCE Hello I did as suggested and still could not ping Thanks for your suggestion RVCE Hello for the sake of completeness and since I had this labbed in GNS3 here are the working configs for all four devices I took the unnecessary static routes and the OSPF network statements under the SPF process out since those are redundant CoreRT

Hello on RR1 if you redistribute the static and the BGP routes into OSPF you can specify the metric type as type 1 or type 2 so these are your options If you issue the command sh ip bgp ribfailure the routes listed will probably tell you that the reason for the RIB failure is that they have a higher administrative distance You can set the administrative distance manually but then your entire redistribution becomes unpredictableso thats not a good idea
Cant SSH to Router After Changing Modulos Size to 512,I was SSHd into a router  changed the the modulos size using the crypto key generate rsa command After that when I try SSH with Putty I get a connection refused error  cant log in anymore Any ideas,HiWithout seeing a debug my guess is that the router or putty is not permitting the connection because modulus size 512 is too weak The recommended modulus for a CA key is 2048 bits try removing the existing key using crypto key zeroize rsa then recreating with modulus 2048HTH RVCE I assume there is no way to do this remotely RVCE You can actually fix that remotely if you have your community readwrite configured and have a software that can push the config change to the router In my case I use the solarwinds admin toolset I fixed a lot of my SSH issues with it RVCE I have read only I think Im screwed here  need to console in to fix this RVCE Is your remote access on the vty restricted to only SSH or is telnet also permitted HTH Rick RVCE Good question Only SSH is enabled I should have enabled telnet temporarily when I was reconfiguring RVCE If your SNMP is read only and if only SSH is permitted on vty then it looks like your only alternative is the console port HTH Rick
Route maps,Hello all i am little bit confused regarding routemaps and the permitdeny statement on them more specific i have created the below ip prefixlist BACKUPTRAFFIC seq 1 permit 10254252024ip prefixlist BACKUPTRAFFIC seq 2 deny 1921680016 routemap BACKUPTRAFFIC permit 1 match ip address prefixlist BACKUPTRAFFIC set ip nexthop 1921681501 My question is is it actually needed permit 1 after routemap BACKUPTRAFFIC I mean that the traffic will be handled according prefix lists permit 10xxx and deny 192xxx  Correct If i had the below configuration how the traffic would be handled routemap BACKUPTRAFFIC deny 1 match ip address prefixlist BACKUPTRAFFIC set ip nexthop 1921681501 Would be the same if i had the below  routemap BACKUPTRAFFIC match ip address prefixlist BACKUPTRAFFIC set ip nexthop 1921681501 Thank you,Hi Q Would be the same if i had the below  routemap BACKUPTRAFFIC match ip address prefixlist BACKUPTRAFFIC set ip nexthop 1921681501 Ans Each route map statement has a permit or deny action and a sequence number This route map shows a permit action and a sequence number of 10 These settings are the defaults—that is if no action or sequence number is specified when the route map is configured the route map will default to a permit and a sequence number of 10 Q2 i am little bit confused regarding routemaps and the permitdeny statement on them Ans if the routemap deny is the first statement it will deny all traffic for accesslist 1 whether the accesslist has denied or permit statement and it will then look for the second sequence number to match If there is no other sequence number to match and implicit deny all at the end of any routemap would kick in Regards Deepak Kumar RVCE Hello now with current configuration traffic 10xxx will be permitted and traffic 192xxx will not right ip prefixlist BACKUPTRAFFIC seq 1 permit 10254252024 ip prefixlist BACKUPTRAFFIC seq 2 deny 1921680016 routemap BACKUPTRAFFIC permit 1 match ip address prefixlist BACKUPTRAFFIC set ip nexthop 1921681501 Am i asking because 1921680016 is a supernet and in routing table i have different prefixes 242730  Theory says that prefix lists will match the exact prefix correct RVCE Hi as your question ip prefixlist BACKUPTRAFFIC seq 2 deny 1921680016 I think best is for you 192168003 ge 24 le 24 for more reference httpsccie20728wordpresscom20080519matchingaddressclasseswithprefixlists Q now with current configuration traffic 10xxx will be permitted and traffic 192xxx will not right Ans Yes you are right Regards Deepak Kumar
ip nat outside source NAT to loopback interface inside of VRF,HiIm currently trying to make the following scenario work Traffic comes from Tunnel1 interface configured with ip nat outside and VRF The source IP address is NATted to Gi1 interface set with ip nat inside without VRF Everything works when insideoutside are switched and ip nat inside source  is used but due to previous design choices it has to be this way outside on the tunnelHow I imagine it should work Due to the NAT order of operations NAT should trigger first and then the routing As IP NAT outside is implicitly matchinvrf I created a new Loopback1 interface with dummy IP inside of VRF and with ip nat inside The source address should be IMO translated from Tunnel1 to Loopback1 and then the packet should be routed through Gi1 NAT from physical to loopback interface should be no problemHowever the source address doesnt get translated and packets are just routed Does anyone know why Other proposals are also welcome but Gi1 interface has to be configured by ip nat inside due to previous configuration and cannot be changedRelevant configuration some of the routes are not necessary they are there out of desperation   Some debug info after ping from 19216801 to 1111NAT translations nothing Packets leaving Gi1 source should be NATted but it isntIOS used IOS XE 160304 If you believe IOS XE is the problem I can probably get my hands on real HW but I hope this is not the case Any ideas EDIT NAT has to ve VRFaware to not interfere with other NAT that is the point why the VRF is configured in the first place ,

High Availability box to box for cisco 4000 series,Hi how can be configured high availability on a couple of cisco 4351 or 4451 serie router  someone can help me send a config link,Generally for ISRs high availability is obtained by having more than one with ideally an independent path to your destination If your ISRs are the also the first hop ie gateway you can use a FHRP eg HSRP If they are a transit router you would have routes that know a destination can be reached via either RVCE local HA we can use interchassis ha  RVCE Yes Without it the best you might accomplish is using two different modules for links hoping if one fails the other will not andor dual power supplies if offered The box itself and the CPU are single points of failure

Portfast and BPDU guard behavior,Hi I am getting confused on what happens in these 4 instances1 Recieving a BPDU on a globally enabled Portfast port2 Recieiving a BPDU when Portfast was enabled per port basis3 Recieving a BPDU on a globally enabled Portfast port with BPDU Guard enabled4 Recieiving a BPDU when Portfast was enabled per port basis with BPDU Guard enabledThanks in advance,1 Recieving a BPDU on a globally enabled Portfast port  Switch will immediately put that interface in fwd state 2 Recieiving a BPDU when Portfast was enabled per port basis  same as above 3 Recieving a BPDU on a globally enabled Portfast port with BPDU Guard enabled  switch will shutdown the port in errdisabled mode4 Recieiving a BPDU when Portfast was enabled per port basis with BPDU Guard enabled  Switch will shut down the port in errdisabled mode whether portfast is enabled or not RVCE I found the attached in a book and is confusing me RVCE I agree with the first statement that the portfast enabled interface will go through the stp state beginning from blocking and eventually to forwarding state as long as there is no loop I have doubt about the 2nd statement so I will need to test it RVCE Second statement from the screenshot that you uploaded appears to be incorrect according to this test httplostintransitse20130804bustingmythsspanningtreeportfastontheinterface I hope you will find this useful RVCE So to sum up the attached as that part is still not clear for me basically portfast will be disabled both in if configured globally and per port but 1 When configured globally portfast will be disabled and it will go into blocking phase and run the usual STP process This is clear 2 When configured per port portfast will be disabled but it stays in the Forwarding state just skips the listen and learning phase possibly creating loops temporarily The question is will STP run here then and if required take action on the port if it is found to be creating loops Many thanks
How does the IR829 deliver PoE,Hello teamI will be installing an IR829 in a bus and it will be sourced with 12VDCIm figuring out how the IR829 can deliver PoE in its Ethernet portsIs there any additional board or power source for delivering PoE in this boxesCan all the 4 ports deliver PoE andor PoEDocumentation seems useless for this questionThanks in advanceNor,You will need a PoE daughterboard IR800ILPOE RVCE can the POE module be retrofitted to the IR829 routers RVCE Yes the module can be retrofitted Dont forget that this part also includes a large power supply This power supply will drive the PoE card and the PoE to the ports RVCE Thank you Leo my use case is automotive so I have 12VDC available Does the IR829 step up the voltage to 54VDC or do I need to fit the vehicle with an inverted to 220VAC our country standard in SA RVCE Uhhhhh  I really dont have any idea You may need to get an inverter to convert from DC to AC

DMVPN with PfR,Hello allOur company has MPLS link with remote branches now we are introducing DMVPN with PfR routing using MPLS and Internet WAN links At the moment we have SLA with MPLS provider to prioritize some apps eg SAP etc However with the introduction of DMVPN the MPLS provider wont be able to look at the traffic going through the tunnel Is there any way the MPLS provider is still able to provide optimization or we dont need it because of PfR What could be a good solution Thanks,Depends on how your MPLS provider recognizes packets for priority If they are using the ToS byte by default the encapsulated packets TOS should match the original packets You can also rewrite an encapsulated packets ToS

WAN Link Interuption,DearsI have a link of 7 mbps upload and download speed of wireless point to point connection layer 2 for my branch when I try to copy 5GB file on that link the link consumption reaches to 100 and the file copying breaks after sometime Q1Though the link get fully consumed by 5GB transfer still the copying should not fail  please correct me if I m not wrong it should keep on copying rather than breaking so if it breaking this mean the point to point link is instable  Q2Which free tool I can use to proof to ISP that their link is not stable Thanks,Q1 a stacks TCP might fail if your physical handoff is much much faster than your paths bandwidth It shouldnt fail but Ive seen some stacks give up if they encounter too many errorsDo smaller transfers work If you devices support shaping try that RVCE Dears Do smaller transfers work If you devices support shaping try that yes smaller transfer work 1GB file I have not done shaping  the link is on switch and the layer 3 interface is on firewall on switch it is layer 2 trunk what bandwidth measurement tool can justify why the transfer is failing  IPERF can be helpful here or some other tool as per your experience Regards RVCE the link is on switch and the layer 3 interface is on firewall on switch it is layer 2 trunkShaping then might be an unsupported option with your equipment RVCE Dear what is your suggestion for the above issue thanks RVCE You might try policing the output to your CIR  Cisco switch often support policingTry a different kind of host or if available try different TCP stack on host especially for the senderObtain a device that support shapingObtain a traffic managementshaping appliance RVCE I think we need to know more about this environment For example if there is a routing protocol running over this link then the 5G copy using 100 of bandwidth could cause routing protocol packets to be dropped and this could withdraw the routes learned over this link which could break the copy HTH Rick RVCE Rick good point especially if BGP is being used as I understand it doesnt obtain internal PAK priorityTo OP are you running a dynamic routing protocol If so any log of it dropping when this happens RVCE Dears As mentioned above it is a layer 2 trunk with no routing protocols so what I understand is that if a 5 GB copy is initiated on 7 Mbps link then it is not always success to have copied every time it might stop copying due to full bandwidth or interruption or link flutuation I want a reason why the copy is not completing a visualize proof for the failure which software can help me the best Iperf can help me to justify why it is failing  Thanks RVCE Yes you did mention its L2 but without knowing the whole topology setup its possible a higher level protocol such as a routing protocol is still being impacted by congestion on this part of the endtoend pathSo are you saying its the same L2 domain endtoendUnderstand this type of problem can sometimes be difficult to identify the root cause For example using IPerf might work fine as its not your file copy Of course if you can get such a tool to fail the same way that would be helpfulAs an example many years ago I was working on a somewhat similar problem Updating the hosts NIC driver with a release that was literally only out for a week resolved the issue BTW the driver hadnt been recommended but in this case when dealing with something that needed fixing because it wasnt working correctly I thought to try the very latest software for all components RVCE I understand that it is a layer 2 connection acting as a trunk But that does not mean that there is no routing protocol You have not told us much about your environment so we can not be sure But think about this as a possible situation Let us think about an environment where there is a client connected on one side which wants to perform a copy from a server on the other side There may be several vlans on the trunk and one of those vlans is vlan 10 There is a layer 3 device connected on vlan 10 could be a router could be a layer 3 switch might be something else which provides connectivity for the client The layer 3 device runs a routing protocol on vlan 10 to learn the subnet where the server is connected on the other side The client initiates the copy and the copy consumes the bandwidth on the layer 2 link Routing protocol packets get dropped because of the congestion When several routing protocol packets are dropped the routing protocol loses the neighbor relationship with its peer on the other side and withdraws the routing entry for the subnet where the server is This causes the copy to fail HTH Rick RVCE Dears I apologize If any of the sentences is disrespecting youll in the post I have restricted to only 2 vlans and rest all are removed and it is a completely layer 2 I want to justify the client why it is failing how I can  thanks RVCE We still do not know enough to be able to identify the cause of this issue I have made a suggestion that there might be some layer 3 protocol traffic such as a routing protocol that might be impacted by congestion on the circuit Larry Sullivan makes a very interesting suggestion that the issue might involve a layer 2 control protocol that controls the wireless circuit that is impacted by congestion What I think we understand is that there is some device at this site doing a copy This device is connected to a switch which is connected to a firewall The firewall is connected over a point to point wireless to some device at the other site which is connected to something which might be a router or switch which might be connected to something might be another switch or might be the other device doing the copy Any one of those points might be involved in this issue I would suggest that as the next step in this troubleshooting would be to post the config of the switch and the firewall at this site In the configs hide sensitive information such as passwords and public IP addresses and indicate which interfaces are for the host doing the copy and which interfaces are used for connection between switch and firewall and firewall and remote site HTH Rick RVCE So if 1GB works fine at what point does the 5GB file fail Does the 1GB max out the speed as well If so for how long What is the wireless protocol that maintains connectivity between the two sides of these wireless devices Is the overhead for this protocol segregated from production traffic as it should be might have to check with provider To prove link stability in general a simple ping test would due To prove stability when speed is maxed out you would have to refer to the previous question about wireless protocol overhead Your provider has probably dealt with these types of issues many times and should have a general explanation for you
cannot trigger a test EEM script with a test syslog message,I have written a test EEM script zscaler2 which is supposed to create a EEM script zscaler3 when triggeredThe trigger is a syslog message I want to test my script before it becomes live So I need to have a syslog messageI expect  TRACK6STATE 178 list boolean and Up  DownSo I have created another EEM script testzscaler2 to write a syslog messageWhen I run the applet testzscaler2 I can see in the cisco log Apr 23 102842785 HAEM4LOG testzscaler2 TRACK6STATE 178 list boolean and Up  Downbut the script zscaler2 is not triggeredHere is my script zscaler2 Any idea how to add the needed syslog message to trigger my script ThanksRegardsGilles,Any tip  I dont understand why the applet zscaler2 is not triggered by the syslog messagesent by the applet testzscaler2 RVCE I found how send log 5 blabla Solved Gilles RVCE Hello I could not get your script to work I think the problem is that the HA facility is not a syslog How exactly did you solve this

Router Internet access  Switch No internet access,Hello all I am new and working on my CCNA I am extremely confused at this point and wanted to see if someone may be able to help me I currently have a router 2611XM that is configured and working properly If I place a host connection on fa01 I have lan and internet access However when I place a connection between fa01 on my router to any port on my switch 2950 I do not have internet access I have created vlan99 on ports fa018 and am currently working with this If i connect a cable direct from my modem to any port on the switch I do have internet access on both vlan1 and 99 I think that it is a dns issue but can not figure it out Any help would be appreciated I have added my running config for the switch Thank you Devin Current configuration

IDBut the update source address is importantAs it was not configured on your old router it was using the IP address of the interface nearest to the neighbor I believePossibly you are using a different connection now or a different IP address on the interfaceThe easiest way would be asking the guys administering the neighbor router Which IP address for my neighbor is configured on your routerIf this does not help you can also ask them Why are you refusing my BGP sessionSometimes asking your colleague a stupid question saves you hours of your time HTHMilan RVCE Hi StuartInstead of beating around the bush I would recommend you to setup a confcall with your BGP Neighbours Admin and remove entire BGP config from both endsCheck if you can ping 621248 and telnet the peer on 179 portOnce that is

for me But I want to know why it was happening I had a different topology but in my topology the routers were running OSPF and the loopback add were also advertised and were reachable from each router still the BGP never came up but when I configured the updatesource it came up What was the reason RVCE Without the updatesource command the session will be established using the IP address of the

Limit incoming traffic on Internet connection,Hello We have a Cisco Nexus 9396PX with a 10GB Telus internet connection but get charged for any traffic above 6GB Whats the best way to ratelimit the amount of incoming traffic allowed on the link without dropping packets ThanksLB,Hello on the Nexus 9K your for inbound QoS are limited The below drops everything inbound above 6GB policymap LIMIT6GBIN class classdefault police cir 6000000000 conform transmit violate drop  interface TenGigabitEthernet000servicepolicy LIMIT6GBIN in You can change the violate action to set dscp or cos and transmit otherwise everything above 6GB will be dropped RVCE Thanks Georg So if we limit the bandwidth incoming on our device will the amount of traffic our ISP sends to our device adjust accordingly Or will they continue to bombard us with traffic and charge based on the amount they send RVCE If the traffic is of a type that slows it transmission rate when there are drops although your OP did ask for a solution without dropping packets  see my other post detected eg TCP ingress rate will be throttled but you will still be paying for overages before the packets are dropped RVCE I dont think what youre asking makes sense If packets arent dropped they are buffered Once the buffer is full packets are dropped Buffers arent that big RVCE The best way would probably be to use a 3rd party traffic shaping applianceWithout it you might try shaping outbound TCP ACKs It works but it will be difficult to obtain a precise ingress rate

Priority class congestion,I have a QoS policy that Im trying to verify and have run into an issue The policy looks something like this policymap PRIORITIZE class PINGSSH bandwidth percent 50 class VOICEVIDEO priority percent 50 policymap SHAPE10 class classdefault shape average 10000000 servicepolicy PRIORITIZE Basically lets shape all traffic down to 10 Mbs while being sure to reserve 50 of the bandwidth for traffic like pings and SSH and giving priority to up to 50 of the bandwidth for traffic like voice and video This is simplified to an extent but you get the idea Anyway I then have two IxChaiot endpoints on either side of the interface where this policy is applied If I send a 100 Mbs UDP stream matching the VOICEVIDEO class from one endpoint to the other I get 10 Mbs of throughput as the network is not congested and theres no need to apply QoS If I start a TCP throughput test matching that PINGSSH class wait 10 seconds and then start the same UDP stream from before I get about 5 Mbs throughput for each test meaning the policy works just fine However if I were to start those tests at the exact same time the TCP test times out and the UDP test uses all 10 Mbs of bandwidth Similarly if I just start the UDP test and then try and ping or SSH over the network the pings either time out or I get incredibly slow round trip times and the SSH session fails altogether Now Im pretty sure this is happening because of the way priority classes are treated As soon as traffic matching a priority class hits the egress queue its sent straight to the top and shipped out immediately With the bandwidth classes theyre all sent to the bottom of the queue and wait their turn to egress the interface If I send a single ping or a TCP SYN its sent to the queue and then waits there while all that priority traffic goes straight to the top of the queue and sent out I also see my queue depth increase during these times for my PINGSSH class which from my understanding means the router is hanging on to these packets in a buffer Classmap PINGSSH matchany 948 packets 1295850 bytes 30 second offered rate 0000 bps drop rate 0000 bps Match dscp cs5 40 Queueing queue limit 64 packets queue depthtotal dropsnobuffer drops 1000 pkts outputbytes output 9481295850 bandwidth 10 150 kbps That number could remain the same even after 510 seconds implying to me the router is just hanging on to those packets for an excessive amount of time before finally shipping them out Now if I already have a steady stream of TCP traffic QoS works just fine as evidenced by waiting 10 seconds to start the priority UDP stream from the example above but if a large priority stream is already using all the available bandwidth theres no way for a new TCP connection to ramp up This could be the case if there are more video or voice calls going over the interface than it can handle or possibly if a DDoS attack somehow matched a priority class My solution for now is to put SSH traffic into a priority class so that if something like this were to happen I could at least get into my network gear and possibly try and turn off ports or adjust ACLs to try and stop the problematic traffic but Im wondering if theres a better way to do that Any thoughts,Hello which platform is this on eg 4321 router 3560 switch and which IOS version are you running  RVCE The priority commands implicit policer often doesnt engage until theres congestion in the LLQ What you might try is adding an explicit policer to your VOICEVIDEO class also for 50 or 5 Mbps Then see how your PINGSSH class traffic behavesBTW unless your video is realtime you could consider moving it out of LLQ RVCE Unfortunately that doesnt appear to be possible Routerconfigpolicymap PRIORITIZERouterconfigpmap class VOICEVIDEO Routerconfigpmapcpolice 5mPolice and Priority with bandwidthpercent are not allowed in the same class Was that what you had in mind or did I misunderstand By the way I failed to mention that if I replace the bandwidth command under classmap PINGSSH with a priority command my pings work just fine Also this is all on a Cisco 4431 RVCE Yes thats what I had in mind Appears something the later IOS doesnt allow Will it allow an explicit shaper RVCE Unfortunately no Routerconfigpmapcshape average 5mShape not allowed with priority RVCE Alright in that case again you might consider moving video out of LLQ and into a ordinary bandwidth class If the video is buffered streaming video such a class only needs sufficient bandwidth as needed by the video and sufficient buffering to usually work well If its realtime video you may need to keep it in LLQ although a high bandwidth allocation might work too Im hoping a nonLLQ class could use a shaper or policerBTW here a generic policymap that can handle most QoS needs assuming youve placed traffic into the correct classespolicymap genericclass realtimepriority percent 33class foregroundbandwidth percent 89fairqueueclass backgroundbandwidth percent 1fairqueueclass classdefaultbandwidth percent 9fairqueue RVCE Fair enough In my particular case that class was intended for VOIP and video conferencing so Id want to keep it in a priority class There really should never be a case when voice and video traffic use more than the bandwidth allocated by the policy but strange things happen and Im not comfortable with the idea of that traffic using up all of the available bandwidth My solution is going to be to put SSH traffic into a priority class so I can at least get to my equipment in the case that voice and video do end up using up all the available bandwidth RVCE Well I once had a policy that gave high priority to SSH for remote device access too although not LLQ Worked great until the day someone did SCP
IWAN interdc tunnel,We recently upgraded some of our border routers to IOSXE 1663 code to take advantage of the interdc optimization features introduced for IWAN Previously we were unable to path control our dc to dc traffic so this seemed like a great improvement Our Cisco SE advised that we merge our dctodc tunnels onto our main DMVPN head end which provides hubtospoke functionality We planned to use NHRP static mappings which worked great The tunnels formed and our routing protocols took over advertising as they should All sites were reachable even dctodc When I applied the domain blah dcipath blah pathid blah command to the DMVPN head end it removed the previous domain blah path blah pathid blah command It appears that only one of the domain commands can be applied to one tunnel interface at a time My only thought at the moment is that perhaps we should have created a second DMVPN overlay tunnel for the dctodc dcipath instead of trying to merge it with the existing hubtospoke path tunnel Has anyone else run into this while deploying the interdc optimization feature found here httpswwwciscocomcenustddocsiosxmliospfrv3configurationxe166pfrv3xe166bookpfrv3interdchtml,

how to configure mpls vpn,The configuration is done on the Customer Edge routers to make an IPSec tunnel between the 2 sites VRF configuration has to be performed on both PE routers The BGP peering configuration should be done away from the addressfamily The aforementioned configuration sets the VPN link for a backup in the event the key MPLS link fails To configure PE to CE communication inside only a particular VRF you cant however utilize no more than the normal configuration commands that you are accustomed to Minimal MPBGP configuration is really straightforward The next thing to do is to enable MPLS Enabling MPLS is truly an extremely straightforward configuration task After you have configured MPLS on the rest of the P devices you may see the mpls insurance neighbors come up If theres a firewall in place at the remote website its policies will similarly will need to permit the traffic through Routes The firewall requires routes for every single network at the sites to the other side of the MPLS On nonABRs configure the region where the router is The routers are restarted They are used to connect the two LANs Along with MPLS theory you have to be able to configure the routers also Its equally as cheap to get a new router Please see attached,

best router is Cisco 4451 ISR The Cisco 4451 ISR has 1Gb throughput upgradable to 2Gb httpswwwciscocomcenusproductsrouters4000seriesintegratedservicesroutersisrmodelscomparisonhtml Regards Deepak Kumar RVCE Hi Your interface Vlan 300 ip address is not within the same subnet as the default route will you please adjust Best regards Antonin RVCE Hello amikat Thanks for your suggestion However VLAN 300 ip address is not what I can change This address is given by internet provider static IPv4 address directly came from Fiber cable to cable modem What this provider just send us is all I have these You can set your IP address like shown below address  12113331150 subnet  255255255192 gateway  12113331194  this is probably fiber modems address This cable is connected to gi1024 When I connect my PC directly to this modem with given address set it works fine So Im trying to figure out routing 100100100xxx vlan 100 and 100100200xxx vlan 200 to vlan 300 Just connect this vlan 300 with modem I can ping 8888 repeat 500 without problem Also I can ping to 100100100xxx and 100100200xxx connected PCs Again I can ping from PC with address 100100100xxx to 100100200xxx and ip address of vlan 300 no problem but I cant ping from PC to gateway 12113331194 Sorry that Im very new for vlan and route function and CISCO as well Let me know how can I make it to work with this environment RVCE Perhaps posting the entire config sanitized if necessary and the output of show version would be hlpful in determining a solution Thanks RVCE This is all configuration and version info text file Hope it will helpful for your advice RVCE Hi Without knowing the details of your configuration will you please just TRY to change your interface vlan 300 ip address to 12113331193 with the same mask 255255255192 and see if there is any progress Thanks  Regards Antonin RVCE Ive tried to set vlan 300 ip address as you said but this address is fixed by provider so it doesnt work Even I changed subnet mask 255255255192 to 2552552550 as same as other vlan neither work RVCE Hi As I remember this switch model does not support NAT it is supported on Routers Firewalls and robust switches like 65xx 68xx and 9K switches only Some NAT commands can be executed on the switches but they will not work The following link is an example of the devices supporting NAT not updated About other models like Cisco 3850 don´t support NAT either httpswwwciscocomcenussupportdocsipnetworkaddresstranslationnat29283166html Hope it is useful  RVCE Ah yes thanks for your link regarding list of NAT capable switch list According to this information indeed there is no 365024PS model included Means that I cant use this ip nat inside nor ip nat outside If so is there any way to routing internet access from internal vlan devices Im almost desperate to figure out how to do it Sure there is easy way to add small router on top of this 3650 switch and connect to it Or even small SOHO type 4port internet router to connect But what I find is that there is no PORT FORWARDING command working as well ip nat inside source static tcp 100100100100 80 12114131150 extendable If it does not working it is really hard to connect our web server to this switch vlan group Sure I could set port forward from Router to this Switch But again I cant assign port forward from router connected uplink port to vlan Need good advice RVCE Hi As you mentioned the solution will be adding in a router into the mix which will be assigned the VLAN 300 range This router will then perform the NATPort forwarding functions you want In terms of the LAN  It would be best to create a new VLAN and SVIinterface vlan for this on the switch This new range will be then what you use for the LAN interface on the router You will then configure on the switch a new default route pointing it to the routers LAN interface One last thing to keep in mind is your router will need a route to reach the LAN networks via the switch as wellHope that helpsNathan RVCE Hi You could consider the Cisco 800 Router model to make the NAT role and create a routerinastick scheme for your VLANs Selecting the router you must take in consideration the amount of traffic to pass through the 800 model is for Small business or branches httpswwwciscocomcdamassetsprodroutersciscorouterselectorindexhtml Hope it is useful  RVCE Hi The switch will not support NAT Please go with any router Regards Deepak Kumar RVCE HiCould you please tell me which model of Router could fit my needWe need to webappdatabase access from clients App will do simple messaging and push servicesWe are expecting 100000 indivisuals access but not simultaniously Perhaps 1000 to 2000 simple data exchange and push message through our server at same time maximumAny suggestion should big help for me Thanks RVCE Hi How much WAN bandwidth Regards Deepak Kumar RVCE We have contract with provider for 1G fiber 1 line with static IP address I think for our application 1G bandwidth is enough
NXOS Mutual redistribution between EIGRPOSPF,Good evening Im working on mutual redistribution on a pair of 7Ks OSPFEIGRP The situation is my OSPF and EIGRP domains were originally built with no real design Previous admins would just pick random ranges so summarization is difficult to build prefix lists I understand the need for routemaps to prevent loops from redistribution So is my logic correct that I can perform the following on each of my ASBRs Im trying to tag all routes in EIGRP with 90 and OSPF with 110then denying on the return by matching the tags This appears to work in a virtual environment but its non NXOS so wanted some input Or do I have to build large prefix lists to accomplish and have to remember to add any new prefixes EIGRP to OSPF RMroutemap eigrp2ospf deny 10 match tag 110routemap eigrp2ospf permit 20 set tag 90 OSPF to EIGRP RMroutemap ospf2eigrp deny 10 match tag 90routemap ospf2eigrp permit 20 set tag 110 Thank you,Hi Whats your configuration when you do show ip route do you see all tags ThanksFrancescoPS Please dont forget to rate and select as validated answer if this answered your question RVCE I applied the above configuration to my 2 ASBRs and for the most part all looks good However any EIGRP External routes AD170 turn into OSPF routes and then a loop is resulting I assume due to OSPF having an AD of 110 But I cannot reproduce this behavior in my home lab I included a drawing in the main message RVCE So this really isnt an issue after all I wasnt looking at both ASBRs to see how the routing tables looked My External EIGRP route was being injected into OSPF The neighboring ASBR sees my EIGRP route as an OSPF route because of the redistribution and the lower AD wins 110 vs 170 RVCE Usually you would tag routes before and leverage these tags when redistributing to different protocols Let me do a quick lab and shows you what the config looks like Do you have some configs to share then I can fit with your configs ThanksFrancescoPS Please dont forget to rate and select as validated answer if this answered your question
MPLS over GRE not working,Hi guys I have setup 2 PEs directly connected and created gre tunnel over this point 2 point with mpls ip command  Configured loopbacks on both routers for bgp peering Tunnel and loopbacks advertised in ospf for reachability  Bgp and ldp peer established Vrf customer1 on both router are showing routes of both ends which are directly connected I am able to ping site a and site b gateways in vrf BUT i have seen first time that end to end both laptops site a and site b are not pingablePlease can someone give me the solution asap,Hello post the configs of both ends RVCE I have attached 2 files as configuration of both routers I have changed MTU to given over head of GRE and MPLS header as well still issue is same I will appreciate if you can provide me the way that why when pinging from lan is not working as all other ping from router to router is pinging in vrf RVCE Hello sorry for the delayIll have a look and let you know RVCE Thanks George i have time constraint  please if you can help me on fast track please let me know if any other information needed RVCE Hello I have recreated your exact setup in GNS3 with PCs attached to both ends and I can ping end to end So your configs look ok Could the problem be with the laptops  RVCE Thanks George this looks great  Sory i forget to tell you i have also tested on GNS before real routers  thats why very confuse why its happening yes in real scenario my laptop cant ping other side of lan IP but i can ping loopback on local router in same vrf from laptop now when i try to ping any IP which resides on router B which is not pingable RVCE Hello how are your laptops connected directly to the routers A and B thats what I did or is there another customer router in between  RVCE No o have directly laptop connected RVCE Curious if you have tried any debugging to see how far the ping reaches when you attempt to ping the network thats connected to remote router or a trace route That may help narrow down the issue and can divulge where issue might be RVCE Yes i able to ping remote router loopbacks in same vrf from router router but when trying to ping from ce laptop then remote router ping reaches only till gatewayIs there any issue with hardware or softwate RVCE Testing your configuration in gns3 didnt produce any errors and I was able to ping across just fine I know you and the other member have also tested this configuration in gns3 and didnt experience any issues but I still wanted to try it out I dont want to say you have a faulty device in your lab but possibly a software error Whats interesting is that both end devices are having the same issue Did you try debugging on the remote end when sourcing an icmp packet from laptop Can you try accessing router A over telnet from laptop thats connected to router b sometimes it can be easier to troubleshoot a networking issue using tcp I would highly suggest to debug the traffic and see where it is failing If its successful then we will know for some reason its only the ping thats failing RVCE Plz confirm which ios and platform did you use in gns I have in gns 7200 npe400 and in lab 7606 sup7203b with ios 151 advance enterprise k9m RVCE I have both ios codes 12x and 15x but I used code 12 to test your configuration RVCE You have test on 7606 sup7203b platform if yes please share ios with me So i can upload same iosI will be thankfull to you

Ospf between mellanox and Cisco 10gig,HiI have two mellanox switches connected to Cisco L3 switch stack using two 10gig interfaces On cisco two ten gig links are configured as portchannel trunk at L2 and on Mellanox 10gig interface from each switch is connected to Cisco is set on MLAG port channel at L2 OSPF configured on top at l3 on VLAN SVIsThe ospf routing table on Cisco showing two paths to reach 19216820 network that is behind mellanox The ospf reference bandwidth on Cisco L3 switch showing 100Mbps and the reference bandwidth on Mellanox showing 100GbpsHow to adjust ospf to 10gig portchannel interface on both cisco and mellanoxIs there any chance of sub optimal routing because of two paths to the same routeplease see the following picture,Hello 100MB is the default reference bandwdith for OSPF on Cisco In order to change that use the autocost referencebandwidth 10000 command under the OSPF process R1configrouter ospf 1 R1configrouterautocost referencebandwidth 10000 10000 equals 10000Mbit equals 10Gigabit Is that what you are after  RVCE Hi Georg Thank you for you reply As autocost referencebandwidth command needs setting on all routers this would mean I need to set this on routers connected but I have other routers connected to Cisco L3 switch that are out of my administrative jurisdiction and cannot be applied I would prefer an interface command or something that applies on a link between l3 cisco switch and mellanox Because the OSPF is not applied on physical interfaces and enabled on VLAN SVIs is there any option Also the link between the cisco and mellanox is a Portchannel with a total bandwidth of 20Gbps what is the correct option Having multiple paths between cisco and mellanox to reach network 1921682024 would this cause suboptimal route Instead of having one ospf multi access network between Cisco and Mellanox is it better to have a two point to point networks between these two
Routing,Routing Protocols,Hiwhats your query over here regds RVCE A routing protocol specifies how routers communicate with each other distributing information that enables them to select routes between any two nodes on a computer network Routing algorithms determine the specific choice of route Each router has a prior knowledge only of networks attached to it directly A routing protocol shares this information first among immediate neighbors and then throughout the network This way routers gain knowledge of the topology of the network The specific characteristics of routing protocols include the manner in which they avoid routing loops the manner in which they select preferred routes using information about hop costs the time they require to reach routing convergence their scalability and other factors Although there are many types of routing protocols three major classes are in widespread use on IP networks Interior gateway protocols type 1 linkstate routing protocols such as OSPF and ISIS Interior gateway protocols type 2 distancevector routing protocols such as Routing Information Protocol RIPv2 IGRP Exterior gateway protocols are routing protocols used on the Internet for exchanging routing information between Autonomous Systems such as Border Gateway Protocol BGP Path Vector Routing Protocol Exterior gateway protocols should not be confused with Exterior Gateway Protocol EGP an obsolete routing protocol Routing protocols according to the OSI routing framework are layer management protocols for the network layer regardless of their transport mechanism ISIS runs on the data link layer Layer 2 Open Shortest Path First OSPF is encapsulated in IP but runs only on the IPv4 subnet while the IPv6 version runs on the link using only linklocal addressing IGRP and EIGRP are directly encapsulated in IP EIGRP uses its own reliable transmission mechanism while IGRP assumed an unreliable transport Routing Information Protocol RIP runs over the User Datagram Protocol UDP Version 1 operates in broadcast mode while version 2 uses multicast addressing BGP runs over the Transmission Control Protocol TCP

What is the command    change the dont fragment packet on Nexus9k,Dear allwe have a problem on packet set df bit to 1 Dont fragment pass through n9k customer need to change df bit and no need to change interface support jumbo frame on n9kOn Router i can change dont fragment by route mapset ip df On Nexus Os i cant find command ,Hello as far as I recall the Nexus switches do not support fragmentation and reassembly which means the DF bit is always set to 1 and you cannot change that RVCE Fragmentation occurs at L3 not a L2 unless we deal with FR or ATM or other technologies For sure it does not apply to ethernet Other important concept is that the MTU MUST be configured with the same value on each L3 link between 2 routers router1 1500  1500 router2 9000  9000 router3 9000  9000 router4 1500  1500 router5 fragmentation will occur between router4 and router5 assuming that router4 gets a frame with size 9000 from router3 and will fragment in at least 6 smaller 1500 frames to be sent to router5 this is a scholastic excercise as since our ip packet most likely is coming from router1 its size wont be larger than 1500 if you have a MTU mismatch between 2 ends of a link you will have drops in the largertosmaller direction router1 9000  1500 router2 router2 will drop all the frames bigger than 1500 well a little bit more coming from router1 this scenario is clearly a configuration mistake if you enable jumbo support on one link you need to be sure that on the other side of it there is a l3 device which also supports jumbo frames L2 switches simply drop frames bigger than the port mtu but if this happen you clearly configured something wrong Say that you set a L2 port of a L2 switch to 9000 since the mtu is calculated at l3 the real frame size is the one calculated by the L3 device host or router which sends the frame therefore most likely will be 1500 So there is no risk to drop anything on the switch

VDSL 867VAE web page delay  time out,Hi All Ive got an issue on which Im running out of ideas Can anyone offer me any advice  point me in the right direction I have recently switched broadband providers I have a VDSL service from talktalk business prev talk talk consumer and I have an 867VAE as my internet facing router I have it connected and configured and the internet connection is working mostly Weird little things keep happening which is making the connection unusableI am fairly sure its a router configuration problem rather than the line or the network The reason for this is when I connect the talktalk supplied router I dont get these issues And nothing else is changing Same switches firewalls wireless etc in between And it happens across the whole network as well as if I plug in directly to one of the router Fast Ethernet ports and get a DHCP address from the local scope Ive tried 3 different software IOS versions so I dont believe this is the issue I thought Id mirrored the configuration on the talktalk router but I must be missing something Has anyone seen anything like this before Any tips tricks or ideas Many ThanksTom,HiCan you share your configWhen you try to access a webpage can you try in parallels to ping it and do a traceroute and paste outputs of these Do these 2 commands using ip addresses and dns babesIf ping and traceroute works fine using IP but not webpages using names can you check your dns servers ThanksFrancescoPS Please dont forget to rate and select as validated answer if this answered your question RVCE Hi Many Thanks for your response Pings and traceroutes seem to still go through Ive set a continuous ping going and browsed the web pages and the pings continuously go through but the web pages still go through There is no

below Ive left in some of the config because Ive got the 10000 8 network further downstream See attached topology Im fairly sure its not a routing issue although Im open to any suggestions   because when I swap out the 867VAE for the talktalk supplied router it all works fine Ive added in the lease to the DHCP pool and the DHCP excluded address and sadly no joy  I would have assumed it was an ISP issue but the router they provided me works  Thanks Tom RVCE Sorry I missed the picture regards Tom RVCE I do have a number of interface resets and unknown protocol drops and output drops could this

Cants get to internet from inside of ASA,So heres the setup An associate of ours who were trying to setup a VPN tunnel with has a Comcast box that has been provisioned with two public IPs If I plug into the port that is configured with the IP that is dedicated for this VPN connection with my laptop and set the laptop IP to the public Ip that Im using as the outside interface on the ASA 507826236 I can reach the internet without issue However when I put the ASA in place behind the Comcast box and tryo to get out I cannot The ASA has 50782623629 configured on the outside with a gateway on the Comcast box of 507826236 The inside interface on the ASA is 172128323329 with no DHCP setup We will have a single statically assigne dhost hanging off the ASA When I try to get from that host to the internet I cant even though I can reach the wan gateway 507826236 from it and resolve web addresses I entered a route outside 0000 0000 507826236 route in the ASA but when I do show route it says the

dont forget to rate and select as validated answer if this answered your question RVCE I am not using 1721283232 as my inside host I didnt say that i know its the network address and I am using 1721283233 as the ASA inside interface and 1721283234 as the inside host IP I cannot plug it back in and do any tests at the moment but I was able to ping the WAN gateway 507826238 from the inside host going through the ASA Never tried pinging the WAN gateway from the ASA directly RVCE Sorry i misread I was on my iPhone and didnt the read the word network Sorry about that Ok without getting the asa plugged back in it will be a bit difficult to do some tests and found out whats the issue Did you took some debugs or packettracer or logs when you were doing your tests If so can you share them Can you plug it in a lab to test it and then make sure its working fine Afterwards its gonna be just an ip change and route next hop change for outside zone ThanksFrancescoPS Please dont forget to

Is it real story Switch can be WLC,Hi allI am network engineer in KoreaI surprised that CISCO switch can be a WLC only an hour agoMy customer sent me a estimate sheetIn the sheet there are 3 nameCisco WSC365048PSLCisco AIRAP1852IHK9LLICCT3650UPGAfter that I searched about this because Im wondering if 3650 switch can be WLCIn the result I found 3650 can be WLCBut I want to check you guys whether its realThe question is1 If I buy LLICCT3650UPG can WSC365048PSL be really WLCANDIn the datasheet in CISCO web site there is sentence IP Base2 In this point maybe should I buy WSC365048PSS  not L cisco is really difficult vendor ㅠㅠPlease advise to me guysRegardsSK,Yes we can configure switch as WLC Please see below configuration guide httpwwwciscocomcenustddocsswitcheslancatalyst3650softwarerelease3semobilityconfigurationguidebmobility3se3650cgbmobility3se3650cgchapter01001html Please rate for useful post Regards Pawan CCIE 52104 RVCE Yes of course  I rated 5 But I want to know number 2 question Should I buy S or L Do you know it if so please teach me Regards SK RVCE I would suggest IP base not LAN base as you aredoing extend operation WLC other than noramal Layer 2 switching on Cisco 3650 RVCE hi go for WSC365048PSS since its IP base and capable of convergedCAPWAP wireless architecture WSC365048PSS Standalone with

question I want to is Ill give you a situationExample 1 Ill buy Cisco WSC365048PSL 1EACisco AIRAP1852IHK9 4EALLICCT3650UPG 1EA 2 Should I buy LICCTIOS1A x 4ea because Ill use 4 AP  I really want to

commands in WSC365048PS  virtually should i not buy LLICCT3650UPG   sorry so lenghy RVCE LLICCT3650UPG You need this FIRST and then a single LICCTIOS1A for every AP the 3650 is to support So if you want 20 APs then youll need to purchase 20 x LICCTIOS1A In this point maybe should I buy WSC365048PSS  If I remembered correctly IP Base is needed 1850 requires 210w PoE WSC365048PS has only 390w of PoE budget This means up to 18 APs can be connected to a single switch One thing to consider is this HOW MANY APs are going to be connected to this switch The reason why Im asking is the PoE budget of this model RVCE Thank you Leo I have other questions 1 Should I buy unconditionally LICCTIOS1A to connect AP and switch3650 2 Then how many APs on 3650 with LICCT3650UPG by default if I didnt buy CTIOS1A license  3 Buying LICCTIOS1A Is it necessary element in order to use for controller 4 If I remembered correctly IP Base is needed It means that I should buy IP BaseS not L Thank you very much and I hope your reply if possible Regards  SK RVCE 1 Should I buy unconditionally LICCTIOS1A to connect AP and switch3650 If you have access to CCW you wont be able to enter LICCTIOS1A unless you enter LLICCT3650UPG first Depends on how many APs you want up to 50 APs RVCE Can you check whether I understand your reply correctly  LICCTIOS1A is 1 AP adder license I extracted from cisco datasheet The question I want to is Ill give you a situationExample 1 Ill buy Cisco WSC365048PSL 1EACisco AIRAP1852IHK9 4EALLICCT3650UPG 1EA 2 Should I buy LICCTIOS1A x 4ea because Ill use 4 AP  I really want to know question 3 After that everything is going well Thank you RVCE Ok Ive made a mistake Do you have access to CCW Cisco Commerce  Workplace If you dont talk to your Cisco AMSE because its a beautiful tool to generate a bill of material Once you get there you put in the switch WSC356048PSL Now once youve done this click the  symbol and you can add what is necessary including the license LICCTIOS1A no need to enter LLICCT3560UPG and specify how many adder license you require If you go through this method the switch gets delivered with the correct amount of AP adder license already installed otherwise the adder license will come in as an electronic copy and youll need to install them yourself RVCE hi yes a cisco 3650 can be setup as WLC and its actually called a wireless controller module WCM kindly see helpful link httpccnawirelesswannabeblogspotcom201608configuringcisco36503850wirelesshtml RVCE Thank you johnlloyd If I buy them Ill use this link  Regards RVCE Hello

eBGP routes not getting advertised to iBGP peers,Hi  I have a strange situation I have a few routers in an iBGP domain which are direct neighbors with each other Two of those routers  RT2 and RT6  also learn some routers through an eBGP peer on the WAN link These eBGP learnt routes are not advertised to the iBGP peers  What could be the reason for this  For eg  In the below output RT6 clearly has an eBGP route for 10000 apart from the iBGP route So ideally this route should be passed on to the iBgp peers of RT6  RT6 ri 10000 10137671 0 100 0 65000 64601 64600  r 1023725550 100 0 65209 65210 65000 64601 64600  But when i look into the iBGP peer RT2 i cant see the route through 1023725550 passed on to RT2 For eg  This is how the routes look like in RT2 r 10000 10137642 100 0 65201 65000 64601 64600  ri 10137671 0 100 0 65000 64601 64600  what could be the reason for this  ThanksRahul Nair Solved Go to Solution,Hi Rahul BGP only advertise the best path On RT6 the path learnt from 1023725550 is not the best path hence it not being advertised to RT2 Regards Harold RitterSr Technical LeaderCCIE 4168 RS SPharoldciscocomMéxico móvil 52 1 55 8312 4915Cisco MéxicoPaseo de la Reforma 222Piso 19Cuauhtémoc JuárezCiudad de México 06600México RVCE Hi Rahul BGP only advertise the best path On RT6 the path learnt from 1023725550 is not the best path hence it not being advertised to RT2 Regards Harold RitterSr Technical LeaderCCIE 4168 RS SPharoldciscocomMéxico móvil 52 1 55 8312 4915Cisco MéxicoPaseo de la Reforma 222Piso 19Cuauhtémoc JuárezCiudad de México 06600México RVCE Thanks Harold I missed that detail ThanksRahul Nair

QoS applied to input on an interface,What is the best method for guaranteeing bandwidth to an internal host through a router I would like to use the internet facing interface and apply an input servicepolicy map However it looks like I cant do that as I get not supported in input policyBasically I want to use a policymap to set a guaranteed min bandwidth of 20000 to a host defined in a classmap and then apply that servicepolicy to an interfaces inputThere a better wayDoesnt make sense to do it on the inside interface as an outputThanks,HelloWhat is the platformIOS you are referring toNiko RVCE HiFirst can you show us what was your policymap and the classmaps This will help us find why it is not SupportedSecond the best way depends on why do you need it if you need to give more download rate to this host then i think you need your ISP apply the policymap on his router because applying on on your router will be useless as the router is at your end of the circuitBut if you need to give more upload bandwidth to this host then you can either put it in the ingress port or the egress with inbound or outbound directionSent from Cisco Technical Support iPhone App RVCE This is a 2921 router running IOS 1512T1Here are the commands accesslist 101 permit ip any XXX8 anyclassmap CENTRAL match accessgroup name CENTRALpolicymap webconferencing class CENTRAL bandwidth 20000 class classdefault fairqueueinterface gig00 servicepolicy input webconferencing RVCE Can you try to remove fairqueue from the classdefaultin code 15X WFQ are no longer supported please check and let me know if that worksThanks RVCE This is how it looks now classmap matchall CENTRAL match accessgroup name CENTRALpolicymap webconferencing class CENTRAL bandwidth 20000And this is what happens when I try to apply itconfigifservicepolicy input webconferencingWeighted Fair Queueing feature not supported in input policyBandwidth command not allowed at parent level in input direction RVCE Have you able to fix this   Im also having same issue platform is 881 with c880datauniversalk9mz1543M4bin RVCE Ingress policies for bandwidth management generally only support policingYou can somewhat guarantee bandwidth for some ingress traffic by policing other traffic to reserve bandwidth for it For example if you had 1 Mbps ingress if you policed all traffic but X to 500 Kbps in theory youve reserved 500 Kbps for X trafficIn practice though since the policer in downstream it doesnt preclude nonX traffic using more than the policed value However some flow rate adaptive traffic eg TCP will slow itself when it sees drops due to policing Ie for such traffic policing will have some impact but its imprecise RVCE and forgot to mention queing only done on egress if you want to use it on ingress direction then you have to use policing it will help you but this will be more complicated RVCE Okay Ill take a look at policing Thanks Amjad RVCE QOS has the following sequance of operations ClassifyMarkBandwidth and priority Classify is a load on the processor and better to be done while the packet input to the network So it is applied on input interface It could be applied on output also to deal with different WAN technology ATM  MPLS for example And hence it mark the packet Bandwidth and Priority by logic is to be done on the output interface The router may has more than one interface with different speeds Hence each class will have different bandwidth on each interface

Cant Connect to Systems in other Office Locations,Good Afternoon My company has set up a new office I will call Central We configured a 3850 switch connected to a ASA 4406 firewall Every is working fine except for one problem I cant connect to printers servers or computers in our other offices I will call East and West I cannot ping to devices in the east and west offices including the switches located in those officesI cannot map to a server thats located in our east office If I go to the east office for example I can see and connect to printers and such in the west office Likewise if I go to the west office I can connect to anything in the east officeBut the central officenothing I can supply any document you request to help me figure this out Ive been over my config files for my switches but outside of adding a ACL on the new central switch I cant figure out whats going on Thanks in advance,Hi How to both offices are connected Are you using VLAN connectionDirect L2 linkMPLS Can you share ACL configuration along with network diagram httpswwwciscocomcenustddocsstoragesanswitchesmds9000swrel3xtroubleshootingguidetrblgdtsaclpdf Regards Deepak Kumar RVCE MPLS  But I found the problem I added a route to the switch in the east office yesterday I saved it but when I went to the east office today I noticed that the route did not save I put it in again but it wouldnt save I decided to place the route on the switch in the west office and it worked Now the central office can connect to the west office location and visa versa I knew the only thing that was keeping the offices from seeing each other was a route When I added the route to the switch at the east office and it still didnt work I became perplexed and open this thread But now since I am unable to save the route on the switch in the east office I realize the problem is the switch It just wont save Ive even tried to add a test route but that couldnt save that either Then I did a no ip route command for the route I thought was saved but I received no route found from the switch So I think my problem is actually the 2960x switch at the east office RVCE OK now my saving routes issue is resolved The switch only holds 16 routes I removed the routes that we no longer use from locations that dont exists anymore and added the new ones DONE Thanks much Im a newbie so I will probably have some more issues that perplex me RVCE Hi I am happy to know that your issue has been resolved Regards Deepak Kumar

concerned if I do aNo router bgp xxxxx I will get booted again I would appreciate any adviceThank you,Hi Can you check EIGRP neighbor relationship Show ip eigrp neighbor show ip route eigrp I never faced an issue that device is going reboot while you are trying to configure default route or removing bgp Maybe the device is not going to reboot and its temp routing loop or updating the routing table BGP is also slow compared to the EIGRP Regards Deepak Kumar RVCE Hello Deepak Thank you for the reply The reboot was due to me telling it to reload in x minutes I did that so that if I lost connection it would reload from the startup config and I wouldnt have to make the long drive out there I currently have have that interface set as passive but this is what I get with the commands you requested EIGRPIPv4 Neighbors for AS1234 Codes L  local C  connected S  static R  RIP M  mobile B  BGP D  EIGRP EX  EIGRP external O  OSPF IA  OSPF inter area N1  OSPF NSSA external type 1 N2  OSPF

of all as you mentioned that your interface is in passive so eigrp neighborship not possible Are you using EBGP If yes then it is having lower AD value then EIGRP so may you cant see the EIGEP routes in the routing table It is advised to remove this interface from passive and perform neighborship and check the reachability to this port only after that perform all other redistribution or adding to eigrp I dont think without redistribution or adding in eigrp to all local lan you will face disconnection Regards Deepak Kumar RVCE Thank you I do appreciate your time I only put it as a passive interface as not to cause issues during business hours I can remove it after hours and try those commands again Here is my BGP config router bgp 12345 bgp logneighborchanges network yyyxxx184212 mask

put the ip route command in first I get disconnected Thanks again RVCE Hi I think first make eigrp ready and there will no issue in becoming neighbor After that you can go to the static route If you wan to configure a default route before check the eigrp the make it with higher ad value IP route 0000 0000 IP 250 Regards Deepak Kumar RVCE Thank you We are now thinking it might be a problem with that circuit its new and have the vendor looking into that
WAN File Copies  slower 1 direction,We have a 150MB TLS type circuit between our 2 main sites connected to GB fiber ports on each end via Cat6509 File copies between servers with GB LAN connections 1 direction are fast 3 seconds for a 20MB file but can take as long as 90 seconds the other way for the same 20MB fileFlow control is enabled on the link and we do see RX Pauses incrementing and we see retransmits occuring in the slow direction It is not server specific and we have shown that local copies work fineThe carrier has certified the WAN link as healthy and we are struggling with where to look next Any suggestions,If you are getting RX pauses incrementing then that means that from the switch port perspective the device you are driving cannot keep up wih the amount of traffic flow to it So it sends to you RX pauses to try to invoke Flow Control to it If both devices switch port and server or end device are Flow control enabled then Flow control will be invoked  If any of these devices are not flow control enabled or capable of running flow control then you can potentially have drops on the flow Verify that flow control is enabled in both directions and also that the server and end devices are flow control enabled If your 6509 is CatOS then do a SHOW COUNT xxyy command to see all errors on the port You may want to clear the counters If it is an IOS based switch then do a SHOW INTERFACE GIGxxyy and see if you are dropping any data on the Input and Output queuesGood Luck RVCE yes I check that already I changed it from Auto to manual 1000MB  full duplex no difference I need some troubleshooting tips since I feel saturated in troubleshooting this You can use additional software for fast copying filesi use gs richcopy 360 enterprise which has features like copying long file path names copying NTFS file permissions and is not too costly

Redundant WAN design issue,We have two sites that are connected to MPLS The service provider has a PE router on site at each location They are running BGP for our WAN which is extensive It is private EBGP so each site has its own ASN We are redistributing OSPF into BGP and aggregating the private subnets at the site edge We are using default informationoriginate on the PE routers OSPF configuration to advertise the MPLS connection as the default route for each sites core These two sites are linked with a campus fiber and we are running another OSPF process between the two sites The routes over this link are more specific and have a lower cost than the MPLS connectionThere is also a backup VPN over an internet link that will act as the tertiary link and also run OSPF We will be setting the cost of that interface high so that it is a last resort The goals areLocal traffic between the sites traverse the campus linkIf the campus link goes down they can route to each other via MPLSIf one MPLS link is down all the traffic goes out across the campus link to the MPLS link at the other locationIf both MPLS links go down traffic will go out respective Backup VPN tunnels My question is how can I make that default route from the local MPLS router withdraw itself from our Core which peers with the provider edge router if BGP goes down Wont OSPF continue to advertise itself as the DG,Wont OSPF continue to advertise itself as the DG Not unless youre using the always option for your default informationoriginate RVCE So what triggers it to stop advertising itself How does OSPF know that it is dependent on BGP to operate properly Im trying to understand the actual mechanisms Thanks RVCE It depends on whether it sees a default route in BGP
Rate Limiting for Microsoft Robocopy,Hello AllWe have a requirement to limit traffic to 1 Mbps on WAN links based on a specific source  destination ip address pair The purpose is to limit the rate to 1 Mbps for a copy operation between a server and client over the WAN Microsoft Robocopy is being used for copying data which I believe is a TCP based application Now I need your advice that what could be the best possible solution here for eg CAR or MQC policing etc  Keeping in consideration that we need to avoid too many packet drops  our goal is just to limit the bandwith utilization for this specific data copy operation between client and server As we know TCP is having builtin mechanism to adjust window size so what could be the best possible solution without having too many packet drops and TCP synchronizationThanks in Advance,HelloAs for the configuration the MQC is the standard now so I would suggest using that to accomplish your task Please note that the MQC is not a particular QoS mechanism rather it is only a specific style of configuring and orchestrating the diverse QoS toolsRegarding your need I would personally suggest using shaping to limit the traffic bandwidth to 1Mbps for your application The shaping will allow the excess packets to be buffered rather than dropped Also to prevent the TCP from being too aggressive and potentially overfilling your router egress queue and resulting in packet drops I suggest deploying the REDWRED to throttle down the TCP flow should it become too greedyAlso if that is possible I would suggest looking into activating the ECN Explicit Congestion Notification in the TCPIP driver of your Windows workstations and then using ECNbased WRED The ECNbased WRED will mark packets as being excessive instead of dropping them and the end applications will react as if the packet was lost by slowing down the transmission rateMy two cents on this I hope other friends here having their extensive share of experiences in QoS will share their views as wellBest regardsPeter RVCE HiActually I have ONLY option to apply QoS at client side not server side So I can apply policy on WAN router where client sits and I believe traffic shaping can not be configured inbound Regards RVCE HiYou are right the shaping can be configured only on an egress port because it requires a buffer to store the excess packets But I am afraid I cannot help you further right now because I am not sure what is the topology of your network where are the endpoints located what is the direction of the flow you want to control and where is the device located that you want to configure the QoS tools on Can you provide a simple drawing visualizing this information Thank youBest regardsPeter RVCE Hi PeterTopology is simple let me try to elaborateServerSwitchWAN Router 1 WAN Router 2 SwitchClientclient and server are placed at two different locations and both sites are connected through a 4 Mbps IP VPN link client needs to copy some data from server on daily basis and we want to limit that data transfer  from server to client  at WAN Router 2 to 1 Mbps The traffic flow would be from WAN Router 1 towards WAN Router 2 and we can only change configuration on WAN Router 2 so only option is to configure some QoS feature inbound to WAN Router 2 in order to limit the traffic for this particular operation to 1 MbpsThanks RVCE Hello when I try to use Robocopy in a batch file to copy from a directory from C drive to my CIFS share I get error 5 stating that it cant issue the timestampAre there any suggestionsThanks for your time RVCE Perhaps using some other tool like GS Rich Copy 360 would be a good solution as you can have multiple threads upto 256 and can also schedule the tasks That way itll make sure that no packages are dropped and the overall performance will also be increased RVCE Thats because RoboCopy doesnt have the time stamp copying feature and not sure when they are going to update their software with this feature Try using GS Rich Copy 360 It can copy timestamp and has a file scheduling feature as a bonus too
Cisco Router Reload General Config,I am running GSN3 on my laptop to create a test invironment and after write erase how long shoudl ir take to reload Mine has been runnng for aobut an hour now,Hi It should take few seconds my suggestion is turn it off and then turn it on The information traceback showed on the screenshot could have 2 reason a bug or the RAM of the router is not enough Hope it is useful

not using Unless you know which routes are more heavily used than others splitting the routes with route maps and eg aspath prepending wont do you much good either Is it an option to just use default routes  By simply configuring two or three default routes through the 100MB link and one through the 20MB link traffic would be load balanced accordingly RVCE I uploaded a few lines of the show ip route output previously I have a single default route pointed at the larger pipe Are you suggesting I create a default route to the slower ISP and then add more default routes to the faster ISP I wasnt even aware I could have multiple default routes to the same IP RVCE Hello indeed multiple identical default routes will increase the traffic load It is actually a quite simple way to use unequal cost links RVCE Hello regarding the multiple default routes I remembered there was an additional step to accomplish this Check the link below httpslooppacketwordpresscompage2 RVCE Hello sgossen From the output you shared seems like you are receiving only a default route from ISPA and full table from ISPBless capacity So to understand your requirement are you looking at load balancing or activestandby setup where you want traffic to prefer ISPB where you have more capacityIf thats the case i would do it this way I receive only default routes from both ISPs Then use localpref you may also use weight to determine which ISP to use to exit my network Unless for some reason you prefer to install a full routing table according to me i doubt its really necessary in this case Regards RVCE What does the far end destination say with the show ip bgp site IP for a route that can transit both ISPs Or at this router show ip bgp xxxx for a route that transits both ISPs RVCE Hello I did

GLBP cisco 1841 2 interface on same router,Hi there  Basically I am wondering if I can do GLBP with Track between 2 interfaces on the same Router Both interfaces are L3 on same Subnet 11 and 12So Can I use GLBP between thoese two and create a Virtual IP which will be Load Balance between those 2 interfaceEach interface will be connected to 2 stacked switches for redundancy I would do Port Channels instead GLBP but 1841 doesnt seem to support PortChannels Thanks Solved Go to Solution,Hi If portchannel is not supported use IRB instead Heres a link that explain what it is httpswwwciscocomcenussupportdocslanswitchingintegratedroutingbridgingirb1705474110htmlirbconfig Mikael RVCE Hi Yes you are correct that two interfaces connect to switch and the ip address on the interface irb will be used as gateway for clients But for the load balance i think that spanningtree will block one of the 2 interfaces otherwise there will be a loop on the vlan So no load balance but you have redundance Mikael RVCE Hi If portchannel is not supported use IRB instead Heres a link that explain what it is httpswwwciscocomcenussupportdocslanswitchingintegratedroutingbridgingirb1705474110htmlirbconfig Mikael RVCE So I assume the one router that will be connected to 2 interfaces on stack switches I can use IRB to bridge these 2 interfaces with 1 ipDoes it load balance  RVCE Hi Yes you are correct that two interfaces connect to switch and the ip address on the interface irb will be used as gateway for clients But for the load balance i think that spanningtree will block one of the 2 interfaces otherwise there will be a loop on the vlan So no load balance but you have redundance Mikael

CCIE PreRequisite,I have studies CCNA CCNP and CCIE RS courses but not yet certified if would like to go for CCIE Exam is it necessary to be a CCNA  CCNP Certified or i can attempt CCIE without CCNP certification Please assist,Hi there is no prerequisite for ccie you can go with ccie without ccna or ccnp regards Deepak Kumar RVCE Thanks for confirmation RVCE This is the official statement from wwwciscocomgoccie Prerequisites There are no formal prerequisites for CCIE certification Other professional certifications or training courses are not required Instead candidates must first pass a written qualification exam and then the corresponding handson lab exam You are expected to have an indepth understanding of the topics in the exam blueprints and strongly encouraged to have three to five years of job experience before attempting certification  Dont stop after youve improved your network Improve the world by lending money to the working pooror share a meal with a hungry child RVCE Hi As other members have mentioned there is no any requirement to get the CCIE but from my point of view and how you already did is study the CCNA and CCNP courses before in order to get ready and get the knowledge required for the CCIE because once you are preparing for the CCIE you will see it contains a lot of information youll get a deep knowledge and you must have strong knowledge The CCIE is a long way a lot of hours of study slepless nights etc but you must be organized and create a calendar of studies The experiences with the technologies and troubleshooting are important as well Hope it is useful 
NAT issue  Port forwarding with NAT to reach inside server via SSH,Hi Everyone I am having Network devices in 1090XX24 network given by ISP I want to access the server 1060xx behind the ASR 1000 series Router via SSH from the Host ip nat inside tcp 1060XX 22Server IP  Port 1090XXRouter Int IP 2222 extended After the above command I can able to access the Server via 1090XX Router Int IP with the port 2222 it is working and via 22 I am able to take the Router CLI Now the Hosts are not supporting 2222 port So it is possible to map the SSH 22 port for ServerCLI and allocate any other Port for taking SSH for Router CLI When I tried the below command ip nat inside tcp 1060XX 22Server IP  Port 1090XXRouter Int IP 22 extended Router is showing Port 22 is used by System Initially the Link is connected through firewall so I have mapped SSH 22 port to Server 22 port Now as the Link is getting updated I have to connect the Uplink to Router Suggestions for this issue are highly appreciated,Hi there To change the port which the router ssh service listens on use the following command  ip ssh port xxx  cheers Seb RVCE Seb Rupik Thanks for the recommendation I have tried it but still same situation So I have contacted the Cisco TAC for the same and we are currently on solving the issue
Best Practice for desigen,Dear Team We have 2 ASA  2 DMZ switch  2 serverfarm switch  2 internet router and 2 6509 switchPlease help to design the network with best practice ,Hi From my point of view you could remove the Internet routers and replace them by the firewalls so the diagram could be Server switchs  6509 SWs  Firewalls  DMZ Switches If you are planning to use STP you could configure HSRP on the 6509 SWs under the interfaces facing to the Server switches and Firewalls The Firewalls should be configured as cluster you can select activestandby or activeactive depending of your requirements and if your devices support that DMZ Switches can be a stack or standalone switches interconnecte between them using a trunk all the communication between the ISP and firewalls should be through VLANs for example ISP 1 will use the VLAN 10 so the switchport connected to the Firewalls for ISP addressing and the switchport for the ISP must be configured under the VLAN 10 the same for the ISP2 other VLAN I could say VLAN 20 Other scenario is configuring VSS on the 6509 Hope it is useful  RVCE Hi Julio Thanks for your valuable support i would like to share few thing with you as well We have Internet router as well as other firewall also in HA as external firewall Please help for the same I am planning for run the VSS Please share your views regarding the design Many Thanks RVCE depending on the internet router you have you can run physical connections from it to each HA FWoutside or if you have a public subnet sit that in between your internet router inside and each FW outside use BGP with local preference for Fail over Please remember to rate useful posts by clicking on the stars below RVCE Hi Good morning Your devices 6509 have the capability to run VSS the following link will provide you the best practices to implement that httpswwwciscocomcenussupportdocsswitchescatalyst6500virtualswitchingsystem1440109547vssbestpracticeshtml Hope it is useful

Load Sharing with different aspath length,I know that we can use bgp bestpath aspath multipathrelax for multihomed solution with same aspath length Is there anyway to have multipath for different path length Such as Network Next Hop Metric LocPrf Weight Path  108017024 17216265 0 0 65002 i  1721611 0 65001 65002 65002 i Show from AS65000 Requirement is Because provider issues we cannot provide same 2 providers for AS65002 as other branches So we need to use AS65000 as hub to route to other branches For each branches I can use prepend to utilize both links as multipath But I cannot use it at AS65000 because itll effect these paths,Hi You can use bgp bestpath aspath ignore Regards Terence RVCE Already tested that solutionNot seem to work for MultipathWhen I apply bgp alwayscomparemed it still only choose 1 best pathPlease note that I already added maximumpath 5 RVCE Hi You can try the below It is a bit dirty but it should work routemap ASPATH permit 10 set aspath prepend 65002 65002 router bgp xxxxx neighbor 17216265 routemap ASPATH in bgp bestpath aspath multipathrelax maximumpath 2 The above routemap will allow you to get the same AS PATH length by doing prepending and when use in conjunction with bgp bestpath aspath multipathrelax you should achieve load sharing Please rate helpful posts RVCE My main problem for prepend in was it effect other route advertisement as well There some routes that had to pass through this routerThis router acted like hub of all branches network I can manage to balancing other branches aspath length but if I prepend something in this router Other branch will not load sharingThats why I tried to find solution to balancing routes without effect routes advertisementI saw command bgp multipath aspath ignore but that can only achieve only in IOS XR  RVCE Hi Will be great if you can share the BGP topology in terms of ASPATH between the hub and the spokes so that we can help further As for the bgp multipath aspath ignore it is available on older platforms but it is a hidden command so basically you need to type the whole thing in RVCE bgp multipath aspath ignore I typed the whole thing but not worked What I show is from router AS65000 Requirement is Because provider issues we cannot provide same 2 providers for AS65002 as other branches So we need to use AS65000 as hub to route to other branches For each branches I can use prepend to utilize both links as multipath But I cannot use it at AS65000 because itll effect these paths RVCE Any help RVCE It states that Loadbalancing between two different AS is not possible unlike Loadbalancing between same AS The solution is to configure weight parameter such a way that routes received from ISP1 should be higher than 0 for prefixes 0128 and configure weight parameter such a way that routes received from ISP2 should be higher than 0 for prefixes 128254

00000 vs 00008,hi Guyscould someone help me to understand if we input these 2 default into one router at same time ip route 0000 0000 172101010ip route 0000 255000 Null0sh ip routeS 00000 10 via 172221010S 00008 is directly connected Null0thanksEric,Hi I think this means everything for 00008  0001  0255255254 will be sent to null0 and everything elseNOT 00008 will be sent to 172221010 thanks John RVCE thanks Guys I got a clearly mind now Eric RVCE You are welcome  RVCE For anyone still confused Were looking at two static routes ip route 0000 0000 172101010ip route 0000 255000 Null0 The first ip route 0000 0000 172101010 says anything that matches 0000 with a mask of 0000that means anything and everythingroute it to 172101010 The second ip route 0000 255000 Null0 says anthing that matches 0000 with a mask of 255000that means anything that starts with 0 in the first octet and we really dont care about the other octetsroute it to Null0 You may ask yourself How would the second ip route ever kick in The first one covers it But recall This is an IP Route statement not an ACL ACLs apply the first match but IP Route statements apply the most specific statement that matches So if traffic was sent to 8888 it would be routed to 172101010 If traffic was sent to 1000 it would be routed to 172101010 but any traffic being sent to 0123 or 01002543 or 0000 will be routed to Null0 because while both routes apply ip route 0000 255000 Null0 is more specific RVCE Very good explanation Thanks for explicitely mentioning that more specific routes always take precendence over less specific routes RVCE Hi Eric The network 00000 represents a default route used to reach unknow destinations The network 00008  Addresses in this block refer to source hosts on this network Address 000032 may be used as a source address for this host on this network other addresses within 00008 may be used to refer to specified hosts on this network RFC1122 Reference httpstoolsietforghtmlrfc5735 As John mentioned I think every host or network into this range 0001 to 0255255254 will be discarded Hope it is useful  RVCE As others already have mentioned A route for 00000 is an IPv4 defaultroute because the network 00000 represents the whole IPv4 address space it means network part of the ip addresses in this network is 0 bits long so all are host addresses it is the network containing every possible IPv4 address 00008 which is used in the second route statement is the first 8 subnet of the complete IPv4 address space It may be useful to configure a route to Null0 for this network because this network and subnets of this network are reserved and will never be assigned as official IPv4 addresses to companies dont ask me why the complete 8 network is reserved i dont know that but i know that this network is not used for assignments of public IPv4 addresses A route to this network is not a defaultroute because that network doesnt represent the complete IPv4 address space in contrast to 00000 which represents the complete IPv4 address space You may think of a default route as a route to the biggest possible IPv4 network which contains the complete IPv4 address space and this network is 00000 but not 00008  In my opinion it is easier and more logical to look at the defaultroute this way because you may think of it simply as a route to a network containing all IPv4 addresses than to thnik of 00000 is a special string matching the defaultroute all other routes take precedence over this route to 00000 because all other routes are more specific RVCE The 0000 8 range is used to identify hosts on the local networkAddresses in this range can only be used as a source address Themost commonly used address in this range is 0000 32 which a hostwill use when dynamically attempting to learn its IP address viaDynamic Host Configuration Protocol DHCP RVCE The 0000 0 network is used to identify all networks and is referredto as the default route If a default route exists in a routing table itwill be used only if there is not a more specific route to a particulardestination
Changing BGP NEXTHOP PA using Routemap,Hello Members The CCIE Routing and Switching v50 Official Cert Guide Volume 2 says that the NEXTHOP PA cannot be set through a route map the only way to change the NEXTHOP PA is through neighbornexthopself for iBGP and Neighbornexthopunchanged for eBGP Is this misleading or there is something im missing,
mpls and multiple paths,HiI have a question about what the best method to configure an MPLS network where there are two WAN links between sites The intention of the second link is to be a backup and will be only used if the primary goes down I dont want to use the backup link under normal circumstances as I will keep its bandwidth turned down to save money then turn it up when required  I know its a painful manual task but it will have to do for now To stop traffic from using the backup link during normal operation would I use a local pref or prepend routes Im using iBGP throughout the network or do I need to start using TE so I can define paths Or is there a better way to achieve this Any advise on this would be appreciatedThanksJonno,Hi My understanding is your sites are connected via mpls and also there is a separate WAN link for back up over which you are running ibgp if my understanding is current I believe you will run into other issues and will need to manipulate bgp route attributes to make it work the way you want to whether you should use local preference or as prepend I would say one should use both so that way you can control both outbound and inbound traffic it would be helpful if you can provide us a with a drawing of your network
Converting layer 3 port to layer 2,Hi GuysI need to convert layer 3 interface to layer 2 in a 3750 switch That is I have a packet shapping device which work on layer 2 and all the packet from inside interface of PIX need to be pass via the packet shapping device so that it can log all the traffic passing via pixI need to convert two ports ie for example gi101 and gi102 to layer 2 and port gi1031 and gi1032 Layer 3 connected to pix firewall via vlan 49 using switch port access vlan 49 All the traffics passing via port gi1031 and gi1032 should log in the port gi101 and gi102 were pack shaping device are connected which works on layer 2 Can one help me to achieve that plsThankssiva,HiI feel you want to convert routedL3interface to a normal L2 interface then in that case you need to key in switchport command under the interface mode to force the same to act as an L2 interfaceOnce the same is done you can configure the port either as a trunk or access port based on the requirementI feel in your case you want to make that as an access port which you can do it using switchport mode accessregds RVCE Hi SivaTo convert a layer 3 port to a layer 2 on a switch you need to issue the commandswitchportto convert a layer 2 to layer 3 tryno switchportHope this helpsMichael RVCE Hi MichaelI need something like monitor or span port  so that I can monitor traffic coming in and out via source gi 1031 and gi 1032 in the port gi101 were the packet shapping device is connected In 3500 series I use to span and mirror the port for capture packet via ethreal for a specific port I need to same capability so that I can capture all incoming and outgoing pack via gi1031 and gi1032 in port gi101 and gi102 in packet shaping device Exinda RVCE You can use SPAN as in 3500 seriesmonitor session 1 source interface gig1031monitor session 1 source interface gig1032monitor session 1 destination interface giga101monitor session 1 destination interface giga102Hope this helps RVCE HiI tried the yesterday and became show stopper for the whole network I have attached the configuration of the switch where I did Please have a look It is a 3750 stake farmsiva RVCE I have seen your config but I can not identify source ports gig1031 and gig1032 Where are they RVCE HiYou need to first login into interface through config t  then interface etc1 To convert layer 3 to layer 2 no switchport 2 To convert layer2 to layer 3 switchport This will solve your problem please rate this postMinu RVCE Switchconfiginterface FastEthernet 01 Switchconfigifno switchport Switchconfigifip address 200111 2552552550 Switchconfigifno shutdown The no switchport command makes the interface Layer 3 capable
Purchasing a Cisco ASA 5506X,Hi everyone I am looking to buy a Cisco ASA 5506X and I had 2 questions 1 Can this device port forward to other devices in different subnets2 Is there a management GUI or does it have all have to be configured through a terminal Thank you Solved Go to Solution,The ASA5506 can be configured to perform port forwarding to devices in different subnets While you can use CLI to configure the ASA it does support a GUI ASDM for configuration and for management HTH Rick RVCE The ASA5506 can be configured to perform port forwarding to devices in different subnets While you can use CLI to configure the ASA it does support a GUI ASDM for configuration and for management HTH Rick RVCE Do you if I purchase the device it comes with instruction to enable ASDM so I can configure the device via a GUI I feel like I would need support otherwise RVCE If you purchase the ASA506 you should be able to easily find instructions for how to enable ASDM The ASA is a fairly sophisticated device If you are not familiar with it you may need some support to assist in understanding how to configure it to achieve your requirements this it true of both configuration using CLI and using ASDM HTH Rick RVCE Alright thank you I will contact support in case I need additional assistance I will be sure to record the serial number in case I may need it I truly appreciate your advice RVCE hi you should be able to use ASDM check the current ASDM installed with a show version command i had ASDM 781 on my ASA 5506x and i used java 18031 on my windows 7 machine youll notice theres 3 new FirePower tabs see helpful link httpccnpsecuritywannabeblogspotcom201801configuringciscoasafirepowermodulehtml RVCE I am glad that our responses have been helpful Thank you for marking this question as solved This will help other readers in the forum to identify discussions which have helpful information These forums are excellent places to ask questions and to learn about networking I hope to see you continue to be active in the forums HTH Rick RVCE Thank you so much for the link Its very useful So I am guessing that ASDM is a piece of software you install to manage the ASA through a GUI I was thinking you could access the ASA through IP on the browser and manage it that way Also do you know what the FirePOWER module is for RVCE Yes ASDM is a piece of software You download it from Cisco like you do the OS and put the ASDM software on the disk of the ASA You connect from your PC to the IP of the ASA using your browser After authenticating your session the ASA will load the ASDM software to your PC and after that you would run the ASDM software rather than using your browser The Firepower module provides Intrusion Prevention and other advanced threat detection if you have purchased the license for this feature HTH Rick RVCE I may not be using the FirePOWER module since I already have a firewall in place that does most of the filtering I do appreciate all your answers Rick thanks for being so prompt RVCE You are welcome When I was getting started in networking I found a forum like this this forum did not yet exist and was very grateful for the people who shared what they knew with me I am glad now to be able to share what I know with others I encourage you to continue to be active in the forums HTH Rick RVCE Thank you I just want to make sure that everything that we have spoken about on this tread holds true even if i am not looking to purchase the FirePOWER license If that does not have any impact i will purchase the device RVCE What we have talked about in this thread for port forwarding and for managing the ASA using the GUI ASDM holds true whether or not you use Firepower HTH Rick RVCE So we are deciding to spend more money was looking at the Cisco ISR 4331 and the Cisco ISR 4431 do you know if these can also be managed through a GUI and have the potential of port forwarding traffic to devices in a different subnet RVCE The ISR routers do support port forwarding My experience is that IOS routers do have a web based interface but it is not as full featured as the ASDM for ASA They are more commonly configured and managed from the CLI HTH Rick
Cisco RV340 Initial Configuration,Im attempting to add an RV340 to our existing networkOur WAN is a Static IP and our local LAN IP for this is 19216811 which is currently a modemOur DHCP and DNS server is 19216812This Domain controller points all internet traffic to the address 19216811The RV340 is intended to provide VPN access to our domainSo far I have not been able to get internet connectivity with the modem connected to the RV340 at all either just these two devices and a PC or on the domainCurrently haveWAN1 configured to our WAN Static IP using our hosts DNS1 and DNS2VLAN1 connected as 19216811 tagged to LAN1 and LAN2 portsChanged the modem IP to 1921681254Ive tried other settings for the VLAN and WAN but these have not been successful either using the WAN as the modem at 19216811Hopefully Ive explained this as clearly as possibleAny help or suggestions would be much appreciated,After some tracing we discovered that the modem supplied by the ISP was inadequate and they supplied a different model which I have setup in Bridge mode I have this configured as 1921681254 and the Cisco Router as 19216811 Internet connectivity works fine when connected to the modem but there is none when connected to the Cisco Router WAN1 is configured using Static IP VLAN1 is configured as 19216811 and tagged to the LAN1 and LAN2 connections on the Cisco Any suggestions on where to investigate or recommendations for settings Thanks RVCE After more tracing the second modem supplied by the ISP was also not supported Weve purchased our own modem and the Router connects with no issue RVCE What modems were you having issues with What presented itself that led you to this conclusion Im struggling to get dualWAN dualstack IPV6 working and am starting to wonder about one of my modems my second WAN is a FIOS ONT harder to reset but its my tunnel so less problematic RVCE how did you fix the problem I have what sounds the same with BT RVCE I didnt I can run my native ISP IPV6 or my Tunneled ISP eitheror If I try to get both working things start to time out and IPV6 fails massively on my implementation Traces start going up one WAN usually the native one and time out I forget where now I probably knew a few months ago I didnt see any mention of any fixes to the tunnel support so I havent talked myself into the integration pain again yet mostly because the single IPV6 ISP is doing the job for now It annoys me though that its not finished right with IPV6 stacks running on both Im no network engineer though Im a techheavy home user mostly from my sw engineering days the baseknowledge part Its still one of the best setups out there this aside for dualWAN for a SMB or home user the segment is oddly not that wellfilled with options IMHO
HELP IWAN issue deploying Brownfield site,Hi AllI have come across another issue with my IWAN deployment using the latest version of APICEMI have started to deploy a branch site the branch site already has reachability and is an existing site using BGPI am managing the router from APIC on its LAN IPThe issue arises when I deploy the site it gets most the way there then fails near the endWhat is happening is that APIC is putting the WAN interface into another VRF then we basically lose connectivity with the site APIC then failsThe most frustrating thing is I have to recover the configs on the router and have to delete the site on APICWhat is the best fix for thisI need to use BGP to the branch if I add the router by its WAN ip to APIC it will still go down because BGP will need configuring with vrf routing Hope someone can help Cheers,

I want to setup a WANLAN Network for an Events Room,Hello everyoneThe truth is that I do not have equipment yet and I am looking to buy it We have a very large property with some rooms and I would like to supply internet to each of them and abroad as wellIt is a property with a party room barbecue areas and several courts The main room has 3000 square feet the smaller rooms are in an adjoining building on 2 floors the barbecue areas are set asideIm interested in covering an exterior area of another 3000 square feet and the 2story building has rooms between 120 square feet and 250 square feet a total of 5 on 2 floors If you need I can provide you with a CADIn conferences there may be more than 500 people Ideal would be with login so I have contact detailsI need router and access points or similar Thanks in advance,Hi You could require 1 router many layer 2 switches PoE the density ports could vary depending of the location and access points like 2702 3702 or the new ones 2802 or 3802 You should deploy a heat map studio before Take in consideration with the copper cables you cannot exceed 90 meters Also the IP addressing you could use networks 23 Hope it is useful  RVCE Thanks for your answer Could you please recommend me routers switches and wireless manager if necesary RVCE Hi You are welcome you could consider the following devices  Cisco Router 4000 series 3900 series or 2900 series compare the hardware specs of each one RAM is important  About switches you could consider the Cisco switches PoE 2960C or 3650C 8 or 12 ports httpswwwciscocomcenusproductsswitchescatalyst2960cseriesswitchesmodelscomparisonhtml Search the model with the word P it means Power over Ethernet You can consider other models with Gigaethernet ports but it depends of your budget The suggestion is keep the same standard of port For example all the devices with Giga ethernet  The access point can be configured as standalone but if you want to have a centralized point and get a better control I suggest a WLC like 2504 or 5508 and buy it with license for X amount of access points 15 25 75  If you are going to use WLC the Access points must be bought with lightweight license K9w8 license if you are going to buy them and use as standalone you must use autonomous license K9w7 You must design your network based on your facility amount of users per access point cost for example for redundancy etc Hope it is useful  RVCE Thanks for your answer What happen if I need more ports on switch I could add another one or regular one I dont understand about WLC or standalone sorry Im novice RVCE Hi You are welcome you must analyze where you are going to install the access points remember that the UTP cable has a maximum distance of 90  100 meters if you consider if you can use a switch only you could consider a switch with 24 or 48 ports like 2960X or XR Otherwise a switch of 24 ports could be wasted NOTE The watts provided per model is very important a switch with 370 watts can provide 155 watts aprox per port on a switch with 24 ports 370  24  1514 an usual Access point can be requesting 11 or 13 watts httpswwwciscocomcenusproductsswitchescatalyst2960xseriesswitchesmodelscomparisonhtml About WLC and standalone access points WLC All the access points have lightweigh image operating system to be used with a Wireless LAN Controller With this scheme the access points dont require any configuration everything is made through the WLC It is ideal for several access points The WLC must be bought with a license for X amount of access points for example 15 25  75 etc Take in consideration if the WLC fails all the access points will fail unless you have other WLC as redundancy Standalone Here the access points use the autonomous image in this case you must configure every access points manually The management could be complex and the APs could have interferences between the channels if an AP fails the rest will be working as normal Hope it is useful  RVCE Thanks for everything I dont understand if you recommend me Cisco 2504 is only for 5 access points what about the rest Ill probably need 6 to 8 So I need a WLC to manage it all at same time Thanks RVCE Hi Cisco 2504 is only for 5 access points by default this WLC has a licensen for 5 access points only once you are in contact with a Cisco partner you must request a license to cover the amount of access points required For example license for 15 or 25 access points httpswwwciscocomcenusproductscollateralwireless2500serieswirelesscontrollersdatasheetc78645111html Hope it is useful

Packet tracer topology,I have a few questions and I hope someone helps me If you have a topology such as the one above how would you configure the distribution switches 1 and 2 and will all uplinks to the distribution switches be active Thanks in advance,Hi This is Packet Tracer so there is some limitations as you cannot configure the stack between your distribution switches So now you are having only few choices as use the routed port L3 between your access switch and distribution switch with static or dynamic routing protocol so you can avoid the STP limitations Regards Deepak Kumar RVCE Hi Beacuse of loops causing broadcast stormsmayhem  Having all uplinks on layer 2 in packet tracer running on the same broadcast domain is not possiblyadvised STP spanning tree protocol protects layer 2 networks from this and you can read about this below But in short it ultimately makes one route to everywhere based on the cost most efficient path but this can be set manually in configuration httpswwwciscocomcenussupportdocslanswitchingspanningtreeprotocol52345html You could technically utilise all links by having different VLANs use different links to maximise bandwidth effeciency And of course those uplinks are always relevent for redundancy anyway You can read about this in the later literations of STP Hope this helps Thanks George RVCE You could set you STP topology so that your distribution cross link in red in your diagram would block first This also assumes you dont have the same VLAN across multiple edge switches BTW Im not suggesting such is a best practice design RVCE Would a basic config for this be something like on both dist switches create 3 SVIs for VLANs 10 20 and 30 apply HSRP and set the ports connecting the switches to trunk ports Also if for example dist switch 1 is acting as the active router for VLAN 10 how would traffic flow if I ping PC4 VLAN 30 from PC1 VLAN10  And what would the difference be if the red link between the dist switch was a L3 instead of a L2 RVCE Yes you could use trunks but again assuming you limit VLAN 10 to SW0 VLAN 20 to SW1 and VLAN 30 to SW2 you could also use access ports to the downstream switchesWith the above if PC1 tried to ping PC4 it would go to its active HSRP GW which would route it on the same L3 switch to VLAN 30 and then the ping would go to SW2 and then to PC4The RED link woudnt come into play assuming all else is up if it was L3 or blocked at L2

VRF Aware DMVPN and Use Case in Connection with AWSAZURE and SDWAN,Apologies Ive been off RS for a while  I need to please ask around use cases for VRF aware DMVPN particularly in connection with the latest WAN technologies and challenges There seems to be a shift for branch offices to splittunnel even though that term seems to be disappearing and the challenges around security and web proxy in the cloud ThanksAjaz NawazCCIERS No15721JNCIESEC No254,
what is vlan0,Hi AllOne of our wireless was setup to send vlan0 I recently found it in the packet capture I couldnt find any thing that could refer to vlan 0Any reference link will also do the helpRegardsRavi,Hi RaviThe VLAN ID 0 is used when a device needs to send prioritytagged frames but does not know in which particular VLAN it resides The basic Ethernet frame does not have any priority field The priority bits also called CoS bits Class of Service are a part of 8021Q VLAN tag Therefore a device needing to add a CoS marking to its frames has to insert a 8021Q tag into each frame However even though this device may be capable of adding 8021Q tags into its frames it may not know in what VLAN it currently residesThis is where the VLAN ID 0 comes in A device that sends CoSmarked frames can insert a 8021Q tag into a frame use the VLAN ID 0 and set the CoS marking appropriately When a VLANaware switch receives this frame the VLAN ID 0 tells it Put the frame in the ordinary access VLAN of the port as if it was untagged however process the CoS field accordingly In other words the VLAN ID 0 represents the access  or the native  VLAN of the receiving port whatever VLAN that might bePlease feel welcome to ask furtherBest regardsPeter RVCE Hi PeterIt makes sense now Can you refer any link where I do further readingRegardsRavi RVCE Hi RaviDownload the 8021Q standard fromhttpstandardsieeeorggetieee802download8021Q2005pdfThen proceed to the page 76 and see the Section 96 Table 92Best regardsPeter RVCE Hi PeterHowever the COS feild here is set to 0 Packet number is 11Please check the screenshotRegardsRavi RVCE Hello RaviNo problem This frame simply has the CoS explicitly set to 0 If it was not marked the switch could theoretically assign some different default CoS to it However here the CoS is specified explicitly  even though it is set to 0 which is the default value for untagged frames anyway Theres nothing wrong with itBest regardsPeter RVCE Hi PeterPlease tell me if these packets when sent on trunk port will retain the VLAN ID 0 Meanwhile I will go through the documentRegardsRavi RVCE Hi RaviPlease tell me if these packets when sent on trunk port will retain the VLAN ID 0No they will not They will instead be tagged with the access VLAN of the port they were received onBest regardsPeter RVCE Hi PeterOK Perfectly makes senseRegardsRavi RVCE What is the purpose of VLAN 4095 RVCE this is fine but the question is we are tagging priority to vlan 0 but how we come to know which packet is marked with higher priority this is not cleare which packet is marked
Quality of Service,i have a network set up with four vlans an i would like to prioritize traffic from a specific vlan to be served first followed by the second vlan etc vlan 3 traffic first  vlan 4 traffic second and vlan 5 then 6 I believe this can be achieved by the use of QoS how do implement this,

neighbor allowasin,What is the command in BGP neighbor allowasin 4when to use it in BGP Solved Go to Solution,Hello AmbrishImagine a scenario like this one A single customer has two locations interconnected via the same provider in ASN 1234 The provider requires that the customer uses BGP to advertise its routes and tells the customer to use the ASN 65001 on both its locationsThe obvious problem is now that if a network X is advertised by CE1 to PE1 its ASPATH attribute will contain 65001 When the route is advertised from PE1 to PE2 and subsequently to CE2 the ASPATH attribute will be modified to 1234 65001 However CE2 is in ASN 65001 itself and when it sees the same ASN in a received update from PE2 it will think that this is a route that is simply being advertised back to the same autonomous system that has already seen it and it will drop it In other words no routes behind CE1 will be visible on CE2 and vice versaCorrectly the provider should configure its PE routers to masquerade the ASN 65001 in these updates using the neighbor asoverride command This will cause all occurrences of the ASN 65001 to be rewritten to the providers own ASN of 1234 so the ASPATH as seen by CE routers would in fact be 1234 1234 However this command is only available for MPLS L3VPN deployments and cannot be used in all situationsTherefore the CE router itself being in ASN 65001 can be instructed to bypass the antiroutingloop check in BGP and accept even those routes that already carry the AS 65001 in their ASPATH attribute This is exactly the meaning of the neighbor allowasin command The optional numeric argument specifies how many times the CEs own ASN can be present in the ASPATH in order for the path to be accept By default it is 3You can read more about the command

will not propagates by ProviderISP for other CE location with same AS running  then neighbor allowasin comes in role now by the help of this command location or CE ROUTER GET THE SAME AS INFORMATION FROM ISP or providercorrect me if i am wrong But still i unable to understand why we are giving the numeric value like in command neighbor allowasin 1 234 RVCE From your above answer i came to know that Same As information will not propagates by ProviderISP for other CE location with same AS running Thats not what Peter was sayingThe allowasin command is nothing to do with the provider in terms of propagation of routesIf the provider PEs see multiple instances of the same AS in the path it will affect the routing decisions on their PEs but it will not stop them sending the routing advertisements from one CE to anotherBut without that command a CE device receiving a route advertisement with its own AS in the path will not accept the route So using that command allows the CE devices to accept routes with their own AS in the pathThe numeric value is simply there so you can choose how many times you want to allow the same AS to be thereFor example if you were adding multiple instances of your AS to the path to influence routing decisions within the provider network then being able to define the number of times the AS can be present gives you more flexibility and also helps to control exactly which routes you accept on the CE devicesJon RVCE Thanks Peter  John for your great supportNow one thing more could you give me a demo of Routes updates with this command using numeric value 1 and 4 RVCE If you have something to run it on then run it yourself to see what happensWe have explained how it works it should not be hard to setup a testJon RVCE very good explanation thank you RVCE Excellent Explanation Peter

after that the IPs begin to be Global with the IP 189xxx So Doing NAT or PAT in the FA01 wouldnt work RVCE I think Larry is right Your router can ping the modem because its on the same network subnet

wondering is that the doc shows minimum IOS The IOS that is in the router has higher version Why isnt it worked Is it related only with SFP RVCE Hi could be a number of reasons most likely software related  that 316 is a fairly good version though my GLCTs worked fine in it but we had issues on some earlier images where only v2 sfps would work and not v1 that was stamped on the actual sfp sticker on the back of it Also make sure its cisco branded sfp and not a 3rd party type as some of them dont work at all either theres been a few discussions on the 4331s and different types of sfps not working usually comes down to some firmware or software version missmatch between the sfps and router httpssupportforumsciscocomdiscussion130258014331transceivernotsupportednotcompatible

Dual ISP link for failover with QOS  for voice and data,Hi all I am implementing a solution for a client that requires the use of two wan links with the secondary one as backup and main as primary I also need to implement QOS on 20mb link with 19 for data and 1mb for voicePlease could anyone provide some help as to the best way to implement this Just finished my CCNA but this is a bit out of my depth Thanks in advance,Hi regarding primary and backup its not clear to me if you are intended to use one router or two which kind of routing protocol are you going to use over the WAN links and the LAN architecture Please give some more detail or even better attach a network diagram QoS for VoIP over WAN link is not easy because it depends on many things for example the WAN characteristics Usually I have also to mark Voice packet to ensure that QoS is applied all over the WAN network Generally speaking I would suggest you to configure hierarchical QoS first shape traffic to 20Mbps and then give 1M to voice using LLQ and 19M to other data traffic If WAN link support some burst you could configure something like this classmap matchall VoIP match accessgroup name VoIPacl configure the ACL to match VoIP for example matching the voice VLAN policymap qos class VoIP priority 1000 class classdefault bandwidth 19000policymap shaping class classdefault shape average 20000000 servicepolicy qos Better config could distinguish between VoIP signaling and RTP stream and you should use QoS also over the LAN probably you have enough bandwidth but I have to ensure also low delay and jitter Bye e Please rate if useful RVCE Thanks E So sorry for my late reply The Primary link is going to go through PPPoE and the backup link via 4g I am trying to give voip priority queue at the egress port with 1mb and data lower priority with 19mb I have simulated two wan links in GNS3 to get this running Please could you look at my config below and let me know how I can go about implementing this no aaa newmodelno ip icmp ratelimit unreachableip cefip dhcp excludedaddress 10001 100010ip dhcp pool LAN1 network 10000 2552552550 defaultrouter 10001no ip domain lookupno ipv6 cefmultilink bundlename authenticatedip tcp synwaittime 5track 8 ip sla 1 reachabilityinterface FastEthernet00 description Towards Customer LAN ip address 10001 2552552550 ip nat inside duplex fullinterface POS10 description Primary Link to ISP1 ip address 20055602 2552552550 ip nat outside shutdowninterface FastEthernet20 no ip address shutdown duplex fullinterface FastEthernet30 no ip address shutdown duplex fullinterface POS40 description Backup Link to ISP2 ip address 20155602 255255255252 ip nat outsideip nat inside source routemap NATISP1 interface POS10 overloadip nat inside source routemap NATISP2 interface POS40 overloadip forwardprotocol ndno ip http serverno ip http secureserverip route 0000 0000 20055601 track 8ip route 0000 0000 20155601 10ip sla 1 icmpecho 20055601 sourceip 20055602ip sla schedule 1 life forever starttime nowaccesslist 101 permit ip 10000 000255 anyroutemap NATISP2 permit 10 match ip address 101 match interface POS40routemap NATISP1 permit 10 match ip address 101 match interface POS10controlplaneline con 0 exectimeout 0 0 privilege level 15 logging synchronous stopbits 1line aux 0 exectimeout 0 0 privilege level 15 logging synchronous stopbits 1line vty 0 4 loginend RVCE Hi I guess you cant configure an IGP to receive the default network from ISP1 did you ask them if it is possible  so track could be appropriate Obviously for production network you will configure a dialer for pppoe Over the WAN interface apply the LLQ see my previous post using interf  servicepolicy shaping out Bye enrico PS rate if useful

Advice on how to handle WAN backbone transit hop issues,HiJust looking for advice on how to handle issues with WAN hops that are not a source or destination ISP for which we have services with Lets say my spoke ISP is Comcast who we have services with and my Hub ISP is site owned or could be a ISP we pay for as well and there is an issue on one of the hops that is a different ISP than the source and destination ISP the remote ISP will say there isnt anything they can do about issues on a device in the WAN in Colorado The destination provider will claim the same What do you do Push your provider to contact the upstream ISP to fix the issue Contact the upstream transit ISP and ask them to look into the issue at which point they will blow you off because you are not a direct customer,
NAT over IPsec,Hello I am creating a lab network that has NAT DHCP and an IPsec tunnel Since implementing NAT I have encountered issues with communication over the tunnel Prior to applying NAT I was able to ping the opposite end of the tunnel and communicate between client machines I have tried several iterations and troubleshooting steps yet the reason why it doesnt work as expected currently remains a mystery to me I have attached a topology of the network with router configurations for inspection Any assistance would be greatly appreciated CheersAzCheersAz,
Layer 3 over vPC Data Rates,As seen in the attached diagram I have two sites connected via layer 2 switch stacks The layer 2 switch stacks are connected to a pair of 9508s via vPC All 4 9508s are EIGRP neighbors On the surface everything appears to be correct However when load testing this design Site 1 to Site 2 can max out the 10 Gbps connection but Site 2 to Site 1 only hits about 45 Gbps Everything is the same on both sides from hardware to configuration No FHRP running for VLAN 2000All the physical interface and portchannel interface configurations are the same as above The SVI configuration for VLAN 2000 has nothing more than an IP address and EIGRP configuration vPC consistency check On the Layer 2 switches all the interfaces are very basic trunk port configs only allowing VLAN 2000 on the trunk The odd part about this is everything was working fine until the vPC was implemented Initially 95082 and 95083 were the only two switches with the VLAN 2000 SVI Has anyone ever seen something like this Any specific troubleshooting direction Beyond vPC consistency checks Im not real sure what else to do and the consistency checks are good Thanks,Looks like an issue with the image on the LAN SwitchB stack Switch Ports Model SW Version SW Image Mode        1 16 WSC385012XS BUNDLE UNKNOWN IMAGE NAME UNKNOWN BUNDLE 2 16 WSC385012XS BUNDLE UNKNOWN IMAGE NAME UNKNOWN INSTALL I dont know if this is what is causing the problem but appears to be a problem nonetheless RVCE Bradley Sakdol wrote Looks like an issue with the image on the LAN SwitchB stack Switch Ports Model SW Version SW Image Mode        1 16 WSC385012XS BUNDLE UNKNOWN IMAGE NAME UNKNOWN BUNDLE 2 16 WSC385012XS BUNDLE UNKNOWN IMAGE NAME UNKNOWN INSTALL I dont know if this is what is causing the problem but appears to be a problem nonetheless TAC has confirmed this is due to a bug in version 37x

Trouble configuring VPN sitetosite,Hello everyone First of all I need to say that I am a beginner with Cisco devices only been working with them for a few weeks now Just so you guys know As the topic reads I am experiencing trouble configuring site to site vpn The plan was first to create VPN between a Dlink DSR500N to a Cisco ASA 5505 device but I gave that up since I never got it to work Instead I tried to follow several different guides cisco official book and youtube videos that show how to create VPN Cisco to Cisco since that seemed a lot easier but I still have not got it to work I began troubleshooting and looking for problems where it could go wrong and the only thing I could find is that I get different output when writing in the CLIFor example if I would write RouterconfigCrypto isakmp enableERROR  INCOMPLETE COMMANDRouterconfigCrypto isakmp policy 10  this command should enter Routerconfigisakmp But instead for me this command enter Routerconfigikev1policyWhy is it like that I would be very thankful if someone can help me with this issue Have a good dayMattias,Hi Mattias Your router should be security K9 license if it has please provide us the configuration on the Cisco and Dlink Thank you in advance RVCE I checked the license and it is Security Plus Right now I need to reconfigure the VPN due to a mistake which forced me to restore an old config because the router stopped working Do you want me to run Show runningconfig and then post it hereBest regards RVCE show runningconfig would be a good start It would also help if you provide some description of the network topology and perhaps a diagram showing the network It would also help if you give us a description of what you want the vpn to do what traffic should go through the vpn If you have done some testing it would be nice to see some test results like can you ping from one peer address to the other peer address HTH Rick RVCE I attached a PDF file of the DLINK router config and down below you can see the config of the asa 5505 To describe the network topology we have a office at site A and offsite storage Site B We want to send our backups that are encrypted through the VPN ICMP is set to

RVCE Mattias Thank you for posting the configs I understand your desire to protect sensitive information such as the public addresses of the devices But I am puzzled at your masking of the private addresses Showing something as 10xxx does not improve your security it is after all a private address and we have no way of knowing where it is or how to access it and it presents difficulty in assessing whether the config of the peers match up appropriately I have looked through them and find several issues 1 You define the subnet of the inside interface as a 16 But when you configure an object for it you change the mask to 24 object network netlocal subnet 10xxx 2552552550 pretty clearly the Dlink expects it to be 16 2 Your ASA has an address translation for any traffic originating inside and going outside There is nothing in the config to exempt the vpn traffic from that translation HTH Rick RVCE Hey Richard sorry if I masked the private address too much I didnt know how much I could shownot show If you want I can repost it with the private addresses visible I changed to the correct netmask now but I know for sure that I have put in the correct netmask before but since I have deleted and recreated the objects and vpn setup I think that might be the reason I maybe put the wrong netmask this time How do I enable nat exemption On my other cisco device when I looked at VPN setup it was a little checkbox that you checked and then it was activated Best regards RVCE Mattias It is not necessary to post the config with the private addresses not masked I point this out so that the next time you post on the forum you would think about what really needs to be protected I recognize that there is an instinctive reaction when posting configs in public forum that we need to protect our addresses But we should then think about what really needs to be protected If you have redone the configs multiple times it is quite possible that the other times did use the correct mask I can only provide feedback on the version that got posted The way to do the nat exemption differs depending on whether you are using GUIASDM or from CLI And the approach for natnat exemption is quite different depending on whether it is ASA or is IOS For your config the nat exemption might look something like this nat insideoutside source static netlocal netlocal destination static netremote

IWAN and APICEM Help,Hi AllI have recently deployed APICEM to setup a dual hub site which connects to my branches the typical MPLS and Internet setup per branchApart from the nightmare and bugs getting APIC to work I have finally managed to deploy the main hubHowever as the MPLS for the sites was already in place using BGP when I applied the settings in APIC we lost all the MPLSThis was due to the fact it put a FVRF on the WAN connection to the ISPI have removed this as well as the Tunnel VRF on the main tunnelThere were also some default routes that had to be removedI am using the existing WAN IP addresses to build the tunnels not the loopbacks My question is is this OKit also removed the command ip policy routemap WANTOAPPthe route map was routemap WANTOAPP permit 10 match ip address APP set globalWhat would that be doing,

What VLAN does ping use by default,Does ping use VLAN 1 by default So basically I have Site A with lets say a edge router and 4 switches behind it that is connected to another site B just the same All switches at Site A can ping lets say 1010105 address at Site B except for one switch That switches and addresses at Site B except that one address The switch is trunked just the same has all the same VLANs although it should not matter since traffic is going across WAN and using same defaultgateway just as the other 3 switches at the site that are able to hit everything The ACLs are not blocking the trafficDoes anyone know anything else that may come to mind that I should look at Solved Go to Solution,Just some questions 1 Is the 1010105 IP the only address at site B the switch cannot ping and it can ping others 2 Can the switch ping anything else on the 1010105s subnet 3 Is the switch that cant ping the IP on the same VLAN as the other switches 4 What are the results of a trace route from the 1010105 switch It should tell you where it is being stopped Finally If you have everything set the same switchwise at site A then there is the possibility the ping is getting to site B it may just be the response is not getting back Hope this helps RVCE As a general rule a switch or router will use the IP address of the interface it uses to reach the destination I understand that you have a management IP and a default gateway specified on the switch but it is using the SVI4 interface So something in its routing is telling it to use that interface Perhaps with more information or if you post its config we can figure that part out Anyhow if you want it to use the management IP for the ping you can specify the source address by doing an extended ping Regards RVCE Just some questions 1 Is the 1010105 IP the only address at site B the switch cannot ping and it can ping others 2 Can the switch ping anything else on the 1010105s subnet 3 Is the switch that cant ping the IP on the same VLAN as the other switches 4 What are the results of a trace route from the 1010105 switch It should tell you where it is being stopped Finally If you have everything set the same switchwise at site A then there is the possibility the ping is getting to site B it may just be the response is not getting back Hope this helps RVCE Ok well looks like when doing pings the ping packet will have a source address using the subnet for SVI 4 10104X and a ACL was blocking it The thing I would like to understand is what makes the switch use that source address to ping I believe I could leave the ACL with the permit 1010X statement pertaining to the int g004 on the edge router at the site or remove all the SVIs except management SVI10 from the switch or all switches as all the switches point to the edge router and the edge router does the routing with ROAS Would this be the best option Just to answer your questions prior to me allowing that subnet to the ACL 1 Is the 1010105 IP the only address at site B the switch cannot ping and it can ping others Yes 2 Can the switch ping anything else on the 1010105s subnet No 3 Is the switch that cant ping the IP on the same VLAN as the other switches Yes all switches have SVIs and vlans for vlans 468 4 What are the results of a trace route from the 1010105 switch It should tell you where it is being stopped stops at 1 on the Edge router of the site Finally If you have everything set the same switchwise at site A then there is the possibility the ping is getting to site B it may just be the response is not getting back Hope this helps RVCE As a general rule a switch or router will use the IP address of the interface it uses to reach the destination I understand that you have a management IP and a default gateway specified on the switch but it is using the SVI4 interface So something in its routing is telling it to use that interface Perhaps with more information or if you post its config we can figure that part out Anyhow if you want it to use the management IP for the ping you can specify the source address by doing an extended ping Regards RVCE Yea I dont have the config to paste on here Yes source ping is what I was doing to test and noticed what was going on even before looking at the logs Yes I dont know why it would use that SVI interface as defaultgateway is using the management ip address The configs of all the switches and routers are not too too complicated especially the switches few SVIs either defaultgw or 0000 route to edget Rt 1 mgmt IP addrress no ACLs at switch only Rt etc I will revisit this issue later next week
What IP to use for NAT,Ok lets say my internal network subnets are on 101XX 24 and the IP on the edge router that connects to the ISP is 50505049 and the ISP is 50505050 What is the IP I would use to NAT my 101X network I am not using 50505049 correct Solved Go to Solution,John made an important observation in an earlier response when he pointed out that where to do the translation depends on how many addresses the ISP has given you The original post only talked about having 505050x If you have addresses in a single subnet then they would need to be on the router and the translation would need to be done on the router The drawing makes it clear that you have two subnets assigned from the ISP One subnet used to connect the router to the ISP and another subnet to connect FW to router In that case you have a choice You could continue to do the translation of the router if you choose But you can also do the translation on the FW And I agree with the advice that it is better to do that translation on the FW I do not understand your question about internal translation and external translations If you have a single outside router and it connects to a single ISP then there is no redundancy It does not matter whether you run BGP or not With a single routersingle ISP then you have a single point of failure and no redundancy With a single router and a single ISP you could run BGP But it is not necessary to run BGP in this situation You could get it to work very well with a simple static default route on the router forwarding traffic to the ISP and the ISP would have its routing logic to forward traffic from the Internet to your assigned address block without requiring BGP You could run BGP but that adds complexity to the environment that you do not need HTH Rick RVCE Hi The IP should be 50505049 if you are going to implement a PAT the configuration should be int g00 description TOISP ip nat outside ip address 50505049 255255255X no shutdown int g01 description INTERNALNETWORK Ip add 101xx 2552552550 ip nat inside no shutdown ip accesslist standard MYNETS permit 101xx24 ip nat inside source list MYNETS interface g00 overload ip route 0000 0000 50505050 name INTERNET RVCE Thanks bro Ok lets say I have internal switches then to a FW then to Edge Router which connects to ISP Would I do my natting at the FW or the Edge Rt See diagram RVCE hi it depends on what public IP range the ISP has given you the 49 is the WAN IP address and this can be used for PATNAT overload but if ISP gave you a 29 or 28 or whatever you can use this for your NAT pool or static NAT 11 NAT RVCE Ok lets say I have internal switches then to a FW then to Edge Router which connects to ISP Would I do my natting at the FW or the Edge Rt See diagram RVCE Blue Belt looking at th pic you have Ip add 5050501 255255255252 on your outside on the FW so you will have to do your NAT on the FW not on the edge router Please remember to rate useful posts by clicking on the stars below RVCE Hi The NAT should be configured on the firewall where the public IP addresses are located and directly connected to the ISP  RVCE Oh ok Even if the FW connects to Edge router company first then the ISP router RVCE Yes the edge router company is connected to the ISP router so the router must execute the NAT role in this case the firewall could make the NAT role but internal translations only not for Internet access that role must made on the edge router RVCE hi do you plan to get a public LAN like a 28 from ISP or perform static NAT to advertise your servers to the internet i would suggest do the NAT on the 5585 FW and the EdgeRT just do the routing or eBGP for redundancy in the future with the ISP RVCE Oh ok just as Julio stated shall I do internal translations on the FW and external translations to the internet on the edge routerIn regards to eBGP how does that come into play for redundancy if I am only using 1 edge router RVCE John made an important observation in an earlier response when he pointed out that where to do the translation depends on how many addresses the ISP has given you The original post only talked about having 505050x If you have addresses in a single subnet then they would need to be on the router and the translation would need to be done on the router The drawing makes it clear that you have two subnets assigned from the ISP One subnet used to

the router forwarding traffic to the ISP and the ISP would have its routing logic to forward traffic from the Internet to your assigned address block without requiring BGP You could run BGP but that adds complexity to the environment that you do not need HTH Rick RVCE Oh ok I see Yes only have one connectionrouter to ISP so I was not sure how any routing protocol came into play there Ok let’s say the outside of interface on FW is 5050501 27 and the connecting port on the router is 5050502 27 These ASA statements look about right to PAT everything on a 10XXX 24 object network obj100008 subnet

Enabling Multicast over the WAN with Cisco routers,FolksWe are looking to enable Multicast routing over the WAN At this point of time I do not know where to start with and looking for some inputsWe have multiple offices across the globe and specific to Europe our service provider has mentioned that he can support Multicast streaming on the WAN Now we already have some local Multicast routing going on within an office local to Europe This Multicast stream is sent by a local server and end workstations in the office pick this stream from that serverNow what I am envisioning is using the same local serverwhich sends the Multicast stream to send the stream across the WAN as well Will that be the way going forward Or is there some suggestions on how this design can be deployed ThanksN,It depends on you WAN Generally on dedicated leased lines you can run multicast On some WAN cloud technologies you cannot run multicast natively but you often can via tunnelsOn some WAN cloud technologies you can also run multicast natively if your WAN SP supports it From your post this sounds like your case So contact your WAN SP for additional information for how RVCE When your provider says they support multicast I believe they are talking about mVPN you can check what this is if that interests you but I am mentioning just so you know what it is it sounds like you wont need to worry about thatFor your network it sounds all you will need to do is to enable PIM on your WAN links and make sure all sites have the same RP or use some kind of anycast such as MSDP
ASR1009,ASR1009 support MPLS layer 2 ,Do you mean L2VPN If so yes ASR1K routers are pretty flexible
BGP default route,,Hello my first thought is to simply establish a neighbor on Swindon with Bracknell and use the neighbor xxxx defaultoriginate command RVCE Hi Georg Many Thanks for looking into it and providing the best solution However I apologize for not explaining the Question properly Basically Currently Heathrow is acting as a Head Quarter and rest all are acting as Branches Longterm Goal is to shut down Heathrow and make Swindon as Head Quarter Solution works if there is a single Branch office however there are many Branches and I do not feel to advertise default route individually for every Branch office Hope My query is making more sense now RVCE You cant do what Georg suggests because you do not peer between your sites you peer with your provider PEs unless I have misunderstood what he was suggesting You cant really do this without the help of your provider because basically Bracknell simply sees the PE as the next hop for the default route it is the PE routers that choose the best default route You would need to advertise the default route from Heathrow with a specific community and the one from Swindon with a different community and then your provider would need to choose which default route to advertise to which sites based on the community assuming your provider would do this Alternatively you could create a GRE tunnel directly between Swindon and Bracknell and advertise a default through the tunnel and prefer it over the default via MPLS or simply filter that default route out Sorry but as you do not really control the routing within the MPLS network there is no easy way to do this or at least none that I am aware of Jon RVCE Jon is right my solution would only work in conjunction with a tunnel that would make direct peering possible How is Heathrow announcing the default route  RVCE router bgp 64521no synchronizationbgp logneighborchangesnetwork 10101650 mask 2552552550redistribute connectedredistribute staticneighbor 172232425 remoteas 12345neighbor 172232425 ebgpmultihop 5neighbor 172232425 defaultoriginateno autosummaryR8 RVCE router bgp 64521 no synchronization bgp logneighborchanges network 10101650 mask 2552552550 redistribute connected redistribute static neighbor 172232425 remoteas 12345 neighbor 172232425 ebgpmultihop 5 neighbor 172232425 defaultoriginate no autosummaryR8
Static Routing limits  need a lower cost solution,We recently ordered two 48 port 3650 switches that we stacked We wanted to replace our Force 10 switches that currently do a lot of static routing required because of multiple external private networks we need to route to On reading Cisco documentation we thought the LAN Base would be enough to cover us but now are finding out to do more than 16 Static Routes we need the IP Services license which would cost us over 11000 to cover both switches To us thats insane just to get more static routes we would need around 112 routes due to our unique requirements with overlapping private networks  we wouldnt be using the other services provided with that license Without keeping the Force 10 as our distribution switches  what other options could we look at I was possibly thinking of some sort of router on a stick configuration but are there any cisco routers that would be cost effective and allow that many static routes in dong this,What is your exact model I think LAN BASE wont do it but I am guessing IP Base should do the trick you shouldnt need IP Services but I would like to confirm
PfR ProofofConcept Lap GNS3,Hello All I am currently implementing this PfR solution httpdocwikiciscocomwikiPfR3SolutionsIWAN using Cisco VIRL IOSv 156 in GNS3 I choose to implement EIGRP in place of BGP The DMVPN tunnels are working fine for both MPLS and INET simulation However I am stuck with the PfR implementation The Hub MC and Hub BRs are not communicating with each other and the loopback IPs on them are also not able to ping each other As a result the Hub MC is unable to push policies to other routers How can I fix this issue Do I need to have EIGRP neighbourship with the Hub MC router as well Can anyone please go through the link once and let me know the problem Many thanks Solved Go to Solution,The HUB MC should have connectivity to the HUB BRs and to the branches this is not related to iWAN traffic itself You do not need to use EIGRP just think of this as a regular L3VPN where you keep EIGRPBGP on the WAN connections but you still need to redistribute those routes to your LAN This could be achieved with a default route if you want to but again that connectivity needs to be there RVCE Hello post your GNS3 project file Which part of the linked document are you referring to  RVCE Kindly download the gns project file https000tinyuploadcomindexphpfileid97579340396807441967 was not allowed to upload it Image used is viosadventerprisek9mvmdkSPA1561 I enabled EIGRP on the Hub MC Not in this attached file This is the part where Hub MC has no communication with any other router and it started to work still not getting the right PfR results but at least now able to push policies and connect with the BRs Awaiting your valuable comments thanks RVCE Hello I cannot open the project unfortunately Can you post the relevant configs  RVCE I am using the same configs in the tutorial httpdocwikiciscocomwikiPfR3SolutionsIWAN RVCE It sounds like a routing problem the communication between loopbacks should occur for your iWAN to go up Are you learning routes on your EIGRP if you do a show ip route on your branch BR do you see the IP for the HUB MC in there Would you please send the commands below show ip route HUBsh domain name master statussh domain name border status sh domain name border parentroute Spokesh domain name master status sh domain name border statussh domain name border parentroute RVCE After enabling EIGRP on the Hub MC the iWAN is up now but I am not sure if you have to enable EIGRP on the hub MC as well Below is the output of commands you asked BranchMCBRsh ip route eigrp p 100008 is variably subnetted 5 subnets 4 masksD p 100008

BGP connection collision,I have an eBGP peer that will not be established till a reset the peer about 10 times I turned on ths BGP debug switch and I found that a message saidconnection collisionNOTIFICATION is sento to peer xxxxcode 6 ceaseAnd the BGP peer will be in Active state for long time and it will return back to Connect state and stuk in this stateI know the problem of collision is because the both of peers are trying to initiate the connection at the same time and collision will happenSo I want o know how to solve this problem or how to configure the peer to play only passive or active role,HiUse the following command to configure one side as passiveneighbor transport connectionmode passiveHope that helps  pls do rate the post if it doesParesh RVCE I do not think this is collision related It rather looks like a bug that I have come across a while ago What version of code are you running on the IOS side Also the cease code comes with a sub code Can you please let us know what the subcode is Thanks Harold RitterSr Technical LeaderCCIE 4168 RS SPharoldciscocomMéxico móvil 52 1 55 8312 4915Cisco MéxicoPaseo de la Reforma 222Piso 19Cuauhtémoc JuárezCiudad de México 06600México RVCE Hi Harold What is the Bug ID Im seeing the same thing sporadically on a couple of my routers and I want to see if they are affected Im running Code version is 1631a
Adding PAT within a VRF kills vty SSHTelnet,Im managing several devices that are using VRF lite All works fine for VTY access until I add a PAT statement within the VRF Sanitised config as follows Everything worked perfectly until I put in This is not the first time ive seen it but as im using VRF Lite with increasing frequency to manage devices with multiple WAN links id like to fix it This has been on all versions of 151 on 29xx and 39xxs Any advice appreciated,Hello can you try a standard access list instead of an extended  So instead of accesslist 110 permit ip host 4444 any use accesslist 1 permit 4444 0000 RVCE This makes no difference The ACL 110 isnt even seeing its hit counter increment when a telnet or ssh session comes in I tried a regular ACL as well same problem RVCE Hello since this appears to be a lab post the full configs of both sides including they keys and IP addresses so we can lab this Which RSA key modulus are you using 10242048  RVCE This isn’t a lab so I can’t post the full config This is a sanitised version and I cant telnet so ssh won’t make any difference I have many sites with a similar problem all with similar configs RVCE Hello understood Try transport input all on all VTY lines instead of ssh telnet Does it make a difference if you use the true SSH port 443 in your NAT statement  RVCE transport in all does nothing either Im not attempting to static NAT any port that SSH would use not 2223 or 443 but 443 isnt used for ssh 443 is SSLHTTPS default port This happens the second I put any PAT on in the VRF on any device If I remove the PATNAT statement its fine RVCE I agree with my colleague Georg that using a standard access list with accessclass is better than using an extended access list but I doubt that this relates to the problem described in the original post I believe that you can try changing the transport input to all but I doubt that it will change the symptoms When I have done address translation using two outside interfaces I have usually used route maps to control the translations so that you can match on both the interface and the ACL But since the translations are for different address ranges it probably is ok to configure the translation as you are doing I do wonder about the static address translation you are adding Is Georg correct that the 554 is part of the sanitization and that the port is really 443 Can you tell us what address you are attempting SSH or telnet to access HTH Rick RVCE Hi Richardip nat inside source static tcp 192168020 554 1231 554 vrf InVRF extendableIs the statement thats being added that breaks telnet to the router itself or SSH for that matter This router has 3 WAN links in total and routemaps are widely used in production most sites only have 2 WAN links Unfortunately BGP is not an option here so im having to use vrf lite to segregate traffic routemaps are messy and unreliable at times ive found The port is not sanitised its 554 There is no port forwarding for 22 23 or 443 at any of these sites The first thing I checked was this but the fact it kills telnet to the external interface thats referenced in the VRF ruled that out in my head I can confirm that if I dont have the vrfalso statment on the vty acl that it will not permit telnet before I apply the NAT statements so that part is working applying it preNAT statement enables telnetssh to the WAN IP in that VRF Its when I apply the NAT statement that telnetssh to the WAN IP from any host on ACL110 stops working Unfortunately the IP addresses are realworld so I cant publish them but you can ping them fine RVCE Hello sorry my bad with true SSH I meant 22 of course and not 443 Either way what if you configure a loopback interface make that part of the VRF and then use that for telnet  RVCE Thanks GeorgLoopback is not possible as its a 32 point to point I can access the devices by the other WAN IPs that arent in the VRF but I need accessiblity from all interfaces RVCE Thanks for the additional information and for clarifying that the port in the translation statement is not sanitized It is very curious that a static translate for port 554 breaks remote access It suggests that the static translate is operating on more than the stated port That suggests that it may be a bug in the software I am disappointed to see that you have found this behavior in multiple versions of the software But I continue to suspect that it is a software defect If you have a support contract for this equipment I would suggest opening a case with Cisco TAC But to continue the discussion here I would suggest that you enable debug for address translation attempt SSH or telnet and post any debug output HTH Rick RVCE Thanks Rick I cant enable NAT debug on these are theyre heavily utilised I enabled debug for NAT on the VRF but it showed up nothing even when I tried to use the NAT in the VRF that is working Ill collate a list of the IOS versions but they are all 15x mainly 1 and 2 I believe RVCE Hello I recreated your setup in GNS3 both with IOSv 156 and IOS 152 in both cases it works with and without the static NAT So it might as well be as Richard suggested either IOS or platform or a combination of both dependent RVCE What device is at 192168020 Is there any way to determine whether it is receiving attempts to SSH andor telnet when you are attempting to access the router but it is not working It is interesting that ping is successful when the static nat is in place I wonder whether the ping response is generated from the router itself or is perhaps generated from the device at 192168020 HTH Rick
Cisco Router 1921  High ping with default gateway from LAN,Dear All I have a issue on site with communication On branch site i have a 1921 Router which is interconnected with a 2960x Switch Communication between Router and Switch is via sub interface Router on stick So all end device as  PC Camera Printer etc that are connected to the Switch as the default gateway have the router 1921 On Router 1921 are configured sub interface for each vlan that are configuring on the Switch  My issue is i have high ping with high time  and drop pings with default gateway Router when i tried to ping gateway from all PC on LAN  High ping with gateway appearing when i generate any kind of traffic as  download of any file on LAN or HQ Site or access on any application access on Internet etcOn Router i have configured also ZBF Zone Based Firewall and QOS Can you tell me if it is normal that ping with gateway on Cisco 1921 increasing until 2050 mms when we have traffic and to return to normal ping 1 mms when there is no traffic Configuration are as below  On Router  interface GigabitEthernet0067 description Internal encapsulation dot1Q 67 ip address 1088670 2552552550interface

lose packets and the response time is ok the problem could be the PC or its cable otherwise change the switchport or router port and cable andor SFP Hope it is useful  RVCE Hi Yes its normal for a router to increase the ping response time when other traffic is present The primary goal for the router is to forward traffic Answer ping is on a relatively low priority for the router Try to ping something else maybe a server a a pc so the router just have to route the packets Mikael RVCE Hi Mikael Thank you for all information Can you tell me if existing any offical documentation from Cisco

repliesMohammed Mahmoud RVCE Thank you Can explain me as to how will the routing happen How do i have to configure the routing such that traffic intended to my headquarters  US  subnets is routed there  the traffic intended to my ASIA subnet is routed to the ASIA network Any Link  details would be greatly appreciated RVCE how both the sites are connected with each otherwhat ever i understand is you want to use the same AS number for your USA and ASIA network it means USA and ASIA network will be in the same AS cloudrightregardsDevang RVCE You understood it rightBoth sites are connected to the Internet using different ISPs RVCE i think tunneling will solve your issue creat the GRE tunnel between your two site and try to send and receive the routing update through that tunnel and get the reachablility between the loopback of each site and then configure the IBGP between both but during configuration you have to make sure that your asia site traffic should exit through the ISP of the ASIA and same for US so there you need the routfiltering for outgoing and incoming traffic for the internet and you have to make sure that only internal subnets of the two different site should be reachable via tunnelregardsDevang RVCE HiTeoretically this is ok but you need to ask the ISP in ASIA the smallest Ip prefix they can advertise And also think about prefix ISPs accept It cannot be in the same summarized net you already annonce But I believe that you are aware of thisBRBjornarsb RVCE Are you sure about this It cannot be in the same summarized net Can i use a 24 which is unused in US from a pool of 18 subnet Let me know if you have any docs for this  RVCE HiI have no docs this is practical conciderations from an ISP point of view Lets look at this scenarioISP1 announces 1921680016with same ASpathISP254 want to announce 1921681024with same aspathOk then ISP1 actually needs to allow inputof same net as they announceISP policy differ from country to countrySo Im adviceing you to apply for a second ip nett and a new AS numberIP and AS should teoretically and historically correspond with SOO areaBRBjornarsb RVCE Hi AnandIve worked a lot with RIRs but ive never done this before but basically you should peer with the 2 ISPs in the 2 regions you should advertise 2 different unsummarized subnet to both ISPs for example 2 different class Cs to each this should theoretically work but i strongly recommend that you contact ARIN they are the best party that can advise and help you do the best action to have this working according to their policies and they are really very helpful please contact them via hostmasterarinnet plus of course arranging with both ISPsHTH please do rate all helpful repliesMohammed Mahmoud RVCE Thanks i will do thisJust an anology  Isnt this case similar to Routing I advertise a bigger subnet of 18 from one region Then advertise another subnet of 24 from another region The Network will identify how to reach each network since the lower mask 24 will advertise specifically to that particular region  RVCE Hi AnandYes it is but i recommended that you contact your RIR ARIN and your ISP just to make sure that there is no contradiction with the internet routing policiesHTH please do rate all helpful repliesMohammed Mahmoud RVCE HiIn a local AS this is true but ISP policy isto not accept a prefix in the range its advertising self Same is with AS numberISP do not accept icomming AS witch is the same as its owns This is traditional BGP policies and the reaseon why BGP worksSo I quess that the answer you get is to do as I have posted else you could or probarly will get into trouble BRBjornarsb RVCE HiThe main problem here is the ASPath Site 1 will drop received routes from Site 2 since they are originated from the same AS ASPath filtering to avoid routing loops there are many work around thats why i strongly recommend that you contact ARIN and your ISPs to agree on the optimum solution for your scenarioHTHMohammed Mahmoud RVCE I got this info from Cisco IP JournalBut i am not able to understand whether it can be applicable to AS on the InternetRefer the attachment for the DiagramCan an ASN Be Split Across Separated SubdomainsThere are many cases of dispersed networks that exist in multiple locationsIf these locations are all administered by a single entity it may bedesirable to use a single ASN across all these domains This scenariois possible but considerable care needs to be exercised when designingthe routing configuration Figure 4 shows two distinct subdomains ofAS1 and they are not interconnected internallyFigure 4 Split ASAS 1AS 2 AS 3 AS 4AS 1B1920212825A19202025AS1 A advertises the prefix 19202025 to AS2 and this advertisementis propagated to AS2 AS3 and AS4 When AS4 passes thisadvertisement to the other segment of AS1 B this router rejects theadvertisement because the associated AS path 4 3 2 1 indicates thatthe route has already passed through AS1 Similarly the first segmentof AS1 A rejects the advertisement of 1920212825 from AS2because its path 4 3 2 1 also indicates that a loop has formed Torestore complete connectivity between the distinct parts of AS1 AS1needs to configure static routes at its edges If AS1 A configures astatic route to 1920212825 pointing toward AS2 and AS1 Bsimilarly configures a route to 19202025 through AS4 then theconfiguration enables full connectivityIn more complex configurations where each of the segments of thenetwork is multiply connected the static route configuration becomesmore complex However with very careful configuration a single ASNcan be distributed across multiple distinct networks

Help with WANMPLS BGPOSPF Route Preference,Hello All Im looking for some suggestions on a new network design We have two data centers directly connected and many remote sites DMVPN all running OSPF We are looking at adding both MPLS and SDWAN solutions to replace DMVPN These services normally prefer to run BGP so Im looking at how best to integrate BGP with our infrastructure The issue im running into is BGPOSPF route preference I would like to do mutual redistribution from OSPF to BGP so that all WAN and MPLS sites follow shortest path to data center resources and allow allow for primary path fail over etc The main sticking point right now is that if I advertise data center subnets to WANMPLS then those same subnets are learned back through the second data center the eBGP routes AD 20 are preferred over the directlyconnected OSPF routes AD 110 I currently do not have separate sets of WAN routers so my WANMPLS connections are terminating on my core routers thus the eBGP vs OSPF route preference issue Basically I need the WAN subnets preferred over eBGP and the LAN subnets preferred over OSPF but each acting as a fail over for the other Im trying as much as possible to accomplish this without having to rely on prefix lists and ACLs keeping it all dynamic The reason for this is just because our data centers contain hundreds of prefixes listing and maintaining that list would be a pain Same with summarizing or aggregation Some things Ive tried or looked into1 Raise AD of eBGP or lower AD of OSPF This creates a secondary issue since it is basically all or nothing I can get the OSPF routes preferred over eBGP but then it also prefers ALL routes learned through eBGP from the opposite data center over OSPF and tries to route the long way around to get to WAN sites 2 Run iBGP across the two data centers rather than two separate ASNs I actually got a config working for this because I can use weightpath to prefer iBGP routes to eBGP then OSPF will beat out iBGP routes Id like to stay away from this just thinking long term separate ASNs for the two data centers seems to be a better way to go especially as we might look at converting our current pointtopoint links over to MPLS 3 Use a VRF for MPLSWAN BGP I was able to get this working in a lab on newer code versions using the VRF importexport commands I was hoping that the VRF BGP routes would show up differently in the global routing table allowing me to control them more like OSPF routes with cost However it looks like they are still importing into the GRT as BGP routes with AD 20 With BGP running in a VRF and OSPF running in the GRT is there any way to get those VRF routes into the GRT as OSPF E1 routes or similar 4 Use a VRF with GRE tunnels and OSPF neighbors between VRF and global I havent tested this one but it seems like it would work just a bit hacky and probably not great for production 5 Use a separate set of WAN routers to terminate WANMPLS BGP then connect those to core via OSPF Im sure this would resolve all my issues but getting the extra hardware may not happen Trying to do this via VRFs is my best chance as of right now 6 Route taggingcommunitiesfilters I cant find a good way to get any of this working since both data centers are in OSPF area 0 I cant find any unique values to do matching on without having to list specific prefixes or advertising routers etc This seems like a fairly straight forward setup hopefully I am just missing something and there is a better way to do this Any advise is appreciated,HiBefore giving you any advice or configs can you share please the routing bgp and ospf configs on DC routersOther question is all subnets from DC are contiguous or not ThanksFrancescoPS Please dont forget to rate and select as validated answer if this answered your question RVCE Current configs are simple just standard OSPF everything relevant is in area 0 There are two 10g point to point links between the DCs so we are just doing ECMP between them The new WAN MPLS and BGP do not exist yet Our route table has about 1000 subnets DC1 has quite a mix of subnets and masks in the 108 and 19216816 ranges probably a couple hundred plus random VPN routes DC2 is much simpler only about 50 or so route table entries but limited to a couple 10x16s then public DMZs and B2B VPNs The remaining route table entries are all WAN sites via DMVPN on OSPF all in the 1721612 range That is why I say doing prefix lists or summaries are probably possible I’m just looking for as maintenancefree setup as possible RVCE Hi Ok if you dont want to use any aclsprefixlist I guess you dont want to use network statement as well thinking about BGP backdor command You can acomplish by changing the AD Let me explain  By default eBGP has 20 and OSPF 110  On OSPF you can change the default distance per routes type  On BGP you can change the AD per neighbor lets say you set it to 115  On OSPF you can have define 110 for inter and intra area and 200 for external Here and example sorry I did it using IOU as Im not in the office and not able to do a real lab IOU3 advertises 19216810024 subnet IOU2 advertises 10100016 few 24 subnets IOU1 advertises 1010016 few 24 subnets I assume you have network statements in OSPF to advertise your local subnets Am i right thats why I asked for your routing config On DC1 and DC2 router ospf 10 distance ospf external 200 Here if you didnt do any filter in OSPF routes learned from DC2 through BGP will be redistributed in OSPF to DC1 as external routes and local connected subnets of DC2 learned as intraarea routes and vice versa Now in terms of BGP On DC1 for example my BGP peer IOU3 has IP 1721623 The below command says that every subnets I learn from this peer should have AD 115 instead of 20 distance 115 1721623 0000 in terms of routing RIB on IOU1 you can see subnets from DC2 are in RIB using OSPF but all others external from DC2 are in BGP O 10100024 11020 via 1721612 000953 Ethernet02O 10101024 11020 via 1721612 000953 Ethernet02O 10102024 11020 via 1721612 000953 Ethernet02 B 19216810024 1150 via 1721623 000922 and I shutdown BGP neighbor on DC1 the 19216810024 will be learned as OSPF E2 routes O E2 19216810024 2001 via 1721612 000005 Ethernet02 This is a quick example showing that routes learned from remote sites will have an AD of 115 instead of 20 but always prefered over BGP than OSPF and fallback to OSPF AD 200 in case BGP is down on 1 router ThanksFrancescoPS Please dont forget to rate and select as validated answer if this answered your question RVCE Thanks for that explanation I knew there had to be some workaround I wasnt seeing I tested in my lab and it appears to be working so that solved about 90 of the issue Unfortunately I also have a lot of External routes already in OSPF mostly due to static route redistribution So now how do I handle the existing External routes Lets say DC1 has a redistributed static route to a nonOSPF router DC2 learns that through OSPF as AD 110 E2 If I change OSPF External AD to 200 now that route is 200 E2 I add BGP to DC1 and it advertises that same route to MPLS MPLS then advertises it over to DC2 Ive increased the BGP cost to 190 so DC2 puts that BGP route in the route table as 190 E2 overriding the OSPF 200 E2 that I had Same issue as before but now only on the existing External routes internal routes are fixed since 110 will override the 190 BGP AD I can set a BGP Community when redistributing External OSPF routes to MPLS routemap match routetype external Then on the opposite DC filter that community out of BGP I will lose those external routes in the event of a DCDC failure but keep all the internal routes Or in cases where I have the same E2 or E1 route out of both data centers VPN failover etc I will splitbrain those routes RVCE For this purpose are you ok to use prefix lists or acls Without that Its gonna be difficult Im thinking about 2 solutions  use acl to match all these subnets and increase the AD for this acl OR  use prefix list and conditional route injection I mean you check for example of DC1 receives a route of DC2 from ospf and if not advertise those subnets to bgp The goal is to validate that ospf peering is up ThanksFrancescoPS Please dont forget to rate and select as validated answer if this answered your question RVCE I was thinking along the same lines as you I was playing with using conditional advertisement with advertise map I just dont have it completely working yet My plan was to match an OSPF route as you mention using two advertise maps one existmap for normal operations that would advertise all routes and set a community like 999 then a nonexistmap that would advertise all routes with a community like 888 Then on DC2 I could set my inbound routemap to deny 999 routes but permit 888 routes which would only be sent in the case OSPF is down As I said I dont have this completely working yet right now it seems like one of the maps works and it advertises all the routes but during a failover it stops advertizing any routes at all so I need to try to figure that out But im not using prefixlist or ACL for the advertisement im trying just to match a route map that does a permit all on all the existing routesmaybe this is not supported with advertise map RVCE Can you share the config youre trying to push ThanksFrancescoPS Please dont forget to rate and select as validated answer if this answered your question RVCE Here is one of the configs still inconsistent and Im not yet seeing where the issue is I have two routers setup this way one will

Controlling traffic on central router,Hi I am trying to determine a good method to ensure that a few thousand users are able to share the available internet connection There is one router sadly only a 2951 where everything connects to it has four internet connections and an inside interface pointing to the rest of the infrastructure with many routers and switches and most of the routers running NAT The problem is that the central router has 2x 4Mbps 1x 20Mbps and 1x 100Mbps internet connections How could I stop careless users from using up all of the bandwidth Im looking at shaping and policing but Im not sure how these techniques could be applied to solve this problem The router is sitting at 1GB used memory out of 25GB due to BGP and all that so I suspect shaping might be a bad idea If I go with policing how can I police per user and not just slow down the interface Its okay if the interface uses up most of the bandwidth but Id like to stop individual users from doing that Most of the users only surf the web and read email and Im okay if one of them decides to download a large file or make a Skype call but Im not okay with somebody downloading 100GB during peak hours So Im looking at a way to limit only the users who are causing my problems while offering the best possible experience for the rest Im looking at getting a gigabit link installed but its going to take a while and I suspect that the rough users are simply going to end up using more Any advise would be appreciated,

Dynamic VPN between two 4GLTE Cisco 819 routers,Is it possible to create VPN between two Cisco 819 routers using 4GLTEboth dynamic endpoints What would be the steps without required Solved Go to

kind of setup httpswwwciscocomcenussupportdocssecurityvpnipsecarchitectureimplementation118048technoteipsec00html Please be aware that for the 4GLTE the IP address that is allocated by the IPS is a private IP address and the ISP does the NAT This is what I noticed in my country anyway not sure in other parts of the world Thus make sure the your 4GLTE provider assigns public IP address instead of private IP address HTH Please rate replies and mark question as answered if applicable RVCE While it is quite possible to configure site to site VPN where one peer has a static IP and the other peer has a dynamic IP the peer with dynamic IP uses a regular static crypto map and has a set peer statement identifying its peer and the peer with static IP uses a dynamic crypto map in which it does not need to identify its peer it is problematic to try to set up VPN when both peers use dynamic IP The biggest problem is that if both peers have dynamic IP then both peers would need to use dynamic crypto map because neither peer would be able to do a set peer in a static crypto map The dynamic crypto map says that the device will respond to any request but does not originate any request If neither peer can originate a request then how do you get the VPN started I do not know of a way to achieve what you are asking HTH Rick RVCE This can be done using these Cisco IOS tools I have used

dynamic IP address appears t0 be private or public IP addresses 100xxxxxxxxx 10xxxxxx from network CGNAT Im struggling to make a VPN between them using the DDNS The GRE tunnel or VPN doesnt work Is there any workarund to solve this RVCE The post from Rejohan does advocate that you get the provider to supply a public IP for the 4GLTE connection If both peers have public IP then it would seem pretty easy to get the VPN to work I would think that as long as one peer had a public IP then you could initiate the tunnel from the peer with private IP I am not sure how it would work when both are private IP Rejohan is he one who has experience with this and I leave further suggestion to him HTH Rick RVCE Hi RichI managed to create IPSEC VPN netween two Cisco 4G routers Then i created L2TP tunnel between the serial interface of the routers the L2TP is inside the IPSEC VPN Now i am trying to data test X2 from one serial interface with a loop at the other serial interface but doesnt seem to be working Both IPSEC VPN and L2TP tunnel are up and established Surely i should be able to pass data from one end to another am i missing something here RVCE If both tunnels are up and established then I would expect that you would be able to pass data between the sites If that is not working then there must be some issue Since I do not know the details of what you have configured I am not able to give good advice about what is the problem I can offer some general comments and hope that they might help you find the issue In my experience with site to site VPN when data does not pass through the VPN there are several things that might be the problem  is there possibly a mismatch in the ACL used by the sites to identify traffic to be encrypted  is there possibly some issue with routing on one side or the other which is not forwarding traffic to where it would be evaluated by the ACL for encryption this would work slightly differently depending on whether this is traditional IPsec tunnel or was VTI  is there possibly some issue with address translation traffic being translated that should not be or traffic not being translated that should be I have not ever done an implementation of L2TP running inside IPsec and can not assess whether there are possible problems involved in doing this Perhaps someone else in the forum might speak to this HTH Rick
counters on ISR bgp tshooting,Hello I have an ISR 4000 series router with image Cisco IOS XE Software Version 160306Cisco IOS Software Denali ISR Software X8664LINUXIOSDUNIVERSALK9M Version 1636 RELEASE SOFTWARE fc3 When executing the command show int counters and show int counter errors I get the error message of Counters information is not available for GigabitEthernet003 This is really frustrating as I need to see the counter errors from whats believed to be a bad issue with the sfp gbics andor the fiber optic cabling this is a router that connects to the fiber handoff at the demarc Not sure what to do here because the ISP is saying we have bad optics on our side because they tested their side Does anyone have a recommendation of a command I can run to get information about physical problems or what log I can set to report on that what makes this matter worse is our equipment never prints any logs of any sort of issue and we randomly loose BGP neighborship with the ISP router but the interface never goes down and doing a clear ip bgp doesent do the trick we have to shutnoshut the interface to get the neighborship to form again The only 1 semiusefull thing I found was everytime we lost BGP neighborship with ISP router the lost carrier counter would increment by a couple,Hi Not sure why its not showing any output with those commands but could be happening due to a bad interface Have you tried replacing gbic or using another port on the router I would assume if its bad fiber optic then you should have seen runtcrc error counters going up on the Ethernet port We had experienced similar issue with our isp several months ago where bgp peering will be torn down randomly and when we raised this issue with the isp we were told they didnt find anything on their end It wasnt big of a deal since we had a redundant connection and all traffic would fail over but it ended up to be a faulty module on the isp side and they only discovered that when it crashed That faulty module generated enough warning signals before it crashed but they failed to catch it in their troubleshooting While your resolve this issue I would suggest to use an eem script to shutno shut the interface when it detects bgp peering is down so you guys wont have to manually do it and outage will be minimal RVCE Thanks for writing back Yeah were essentially playing the blame game with the ISP we replaced sfp swapped out port etc The only piece of information they can give us is we have a LOS of 8 seconds from your end I would think that if we experienced a true LOS on our side our interface would shutdown and warn usbut not The first log that appears for us every single time is BGP3NOTIFICATION sent to neighbor 1111 40 hold time expired 0 bytes Thats the best piece of information I have All thats left for us to do is replace the router Do you think you can possible give me a summary of how your failover works like very basic high level configs were trying to set something like that up RVCE Sure it pretty straightforward We have 2 edge routers and each is connected to separate WAN providers Currently we are not doing any load balancing between these 2 circuits and use them as activestandby Both routers are connected to each other via an Ethernet port with hsrp configuration hsrp is configured with tracking of WAN interface if the WAN interface goes down then hsrp kicks in and reduces its priority on the port which is hsrp aware so the standby router can take over The issue that you are currently experiencing was giving us trouble because the serial interface would still be up but BGP peering will tear down and since the interface stayed up hsrp wont kick in We had to write an eem script on the affected router to shut down the WAN interface when bgp peering is down so failover can take place automatically RVCE Great configuration I have 2 questions 1 Lets say the interface encounters slowness do you guys just manually flip the circuit 2 Why dont you loadbalance RVCE 1 Lets say the interface encounters slowness do you guys just manually flip the circuit We dont have such policy because it was never needed But this sort of policy would probably need to monitor circuit utilization We do have a policy where router tracks WAN circuit crc errors and if it hits a certain threshold it fails over to back up link 2 Why dont you loadbalance Customer doesnt want loadbalace RVCE So since you have hsrp as the failover mechanism for tracking your outside interface dont you also need to run iBGP between your 2 edge routers What would happen if that hsrp interface would go down I guess it wouldnt make sense to run iBGP because youre connecting to 2 different bgp

DMVPN as Failover to MPLS VPN,Hii want to implement DMVPN to one of our branch as a fail over link if the MPLS point to point is downThe MPLS VPN is working fine but due to SP faults we are experiencing frequent link downsso i want to place a dsl router at branch and configure DMVPN to our existing HUB routeri am configuring branch router as a spoke to HUB router R3 with rip so when the MPLS which using eigrp goes down  then DMVPN link should be up depending upon AD but my doubt is if again MPLS link gets up will it switchover to MPLS from DMVPNhere is the topology Here is the

siteThen you have two issues at the Head Office site 1 you are redistributing the branch routes into OSPF on two routersYou are also redistributing OSPF into EIGRP on R1 and OSPF into RIP on R3 so you would have to do route filtering because otherwise R1 redistributes the branch sites into OSPF and then R3 redistributes them back into RIP ie you would be advertising the branch routes back to the branchIt works the other way as well ie R3 redistributing into OSPF and R1 redistributing back into EIGRPSo both R1 and R3 would have to filter out the branch routes which may require tagging of routes2 you need to make sure the L3 switch sees the path via R1 as preferredThere are a number of ways of influencing the path eg redistribute with a higher metric on R3 increase the cost of the link connecting to R3 on the L3 switch etcA simpler solution might be possible using just two static routes but it depends on whether the branch will be using that internet connection for local internet access as well as the tunnel or just the tunnelIf it is just for the tunnel and you think it might be easier let me knowJon RVCE Nothing to do with dumbness these things can be hard to visualise and the more you do them the easier it becomesIt just takes time to get there thats allR1 still prefers the EIGRP route yes because the EIGRP routes from R2 are EIGRP internal ie AD 90 which is better than OSPF AD 110R2 however prefers the OSPF routes because its EIGRP routes received from R1 are EIGRP externals and these are AD 170The L3 switch uses OSPF anyway but the OSPF route it uses will be different because it receives 1 an OSPF inter area route for R2s local subnetand2 an OSPF external route for R2s local subnet because R1 redistributed the EIGRP route from R2 into OSPFBut it doesnt matter because it all still worksIts just routes in the routing table as far as the L3 devices are concerned and as long as it has a route it will work fineLet me test this tomorrow just to be absolutely sure there are no unexpected side effects but i cant see that there will beIts worth doing because it would mean no downtime at all for the main tunnel and you dont need any downtime for the backup tunnelJon RVCE am i going in the right directionany suggestion guys RVCE Based on the diagram and information you have provided I would say no you arent going in the right directionYou already have two IGPs running ie EIGRP and OSPF together with BGP and are doing multiple redistribution and now you are proposing to add yet another IGP with redistributionThis is not intended as criticism as there may well be a reason for the current design but from the information you have provided I cant see the reason for using both EIGRP and OSPF let alone adding RIPMaintaining and more importantly troubleshooting this network would be difficult because before you could even work out why something was not working you would have to work out how it was meant to work and that could take a whileThere are also quite a few things in the configurations that dont makes sense eg 1 on R3 you have RIP configuration but no OSPF and yet you are redistributing OSPF into RIPYou would also need to redistribute back into OSPF for the L3 switch to know about the routes2 on the branch hub router you have the route for 749912825 pointing to 19216811Even if you did manage to get RIP routes across the tunnel it would not work because you are also advertising EIGRP routes to the branch via the other tunnel but these are EIGRP external routes because you are redistributing OSPF into EIGRP so they will have a higher AD than RIPYou could manipulate the AD of EIGRP on the branch router but thats fixing a problem you really dont need to create in the first placeI appreciate there are probably large parts of the network you have not shown and these may explain why you are already running multiple IGPs but its not at all clear why it is doing it from what you have told usA really good principle of design is only add things you need to not just because you can It means you can keep the network as simple as possible which makes maintaining and troubleshooting a whole lot easierIf you have a good reason to use both EIGRP and OSPF then I would look to use one of them for the backup link as wellIf you dont it may be a lot easier in the long run to just use one IGP within your sites and work with thatAs an example with EIGRP if you were only running EIGRP then you could pass EIGRP internal routes to the branch via the main tunnel They would be internal because there is no need to redistribute from OSPFYou could also pass the same routes via the new backup linkOn the L3 switch you could add a delay to the interface connecting to R3 and on the branch router you add a delay to the interface connecting to the internetAutomatically all routes via the main tunnel would be preferred and if it failed the backup link would be usedIf the main link came back up those routes would be preferred againI have used EIGRP as an example but you could do the same with OSPFBut it may not be that simple because there may be multiple other sites using BGP to advertise routes to each other and these routes then need redistributing into IGPs so that would need to be taken into account as wellIts really difficult to say anything definitive without knowing more about the topology but I would still say adding yet another IGP would be the last thing I would be considering based on the information you have provided so farJon RVCE Hi JonThanks for the keen observation and excellent reply i know it was very time consuming to go through my post and i can understand how much time it might had taken for your replythere are things i omitted to minimize the config shown upmy switch fabric is of HP including L3 Switches so i have to run OSPF and eigrp to the branch routersand according to the RIP  we have few small branches connected over DMVPN and the spoke routers used are cisco 871 which can run only RIP so i had no other option then to have RIP configured and redistribute into OSPFhere R4R5R6R50 are cisco 871 running rip connected to Head Office over DMVPN so i wanted to use this HUB router as failover to one more branch connected through MPLScan i manipulate rip AD to 200 on R2 asrouter rip 200version 2network 1722000 network 192168500distance 200no autosummaryand leave the HUB router intact RVCE I understand why you need RIP now but Im still not entirely clear where EIGRP fits into the pictureThe simplest solution is to run OSPF across the main tunnel because the routes would have a lower AD than RIP routes so you wouldnt need to modify anythingBut lets assume that you want to run EIGRPIf so can you confirm a few things 1 does this branch have local internet access ie if it has a default route where does it point to 2 R1 is redistributing EIGRP into OSPF and R3 will be redistributing RIP into OSPFSo the L3 switch will receive the same routes via OSPF from both routersIs that correct Jon RVCE Hi Jonyes you are right it doesnt make sense to have eigrp instead of ospf it is an old setup which i didnt change as we have few other branches running eigrp on mpls same as R21 no this branch doesnt have any internet connection except MPLS i am planning to connect one for DMVPN as in above diagram2 yes  L3 will receive the same routes from R1 and R3 RVCE The short answer is yes you would need to change the AD of the RIP routes at the branch siteThen you have two issues at the Head Office site 1 you are redistributing the branch routes into OSPF on two routersYou are also redistributing OSPF into EIGRP on R1 and OSPF into RIP on R3 so you would have to do route filtering because otherwise R1 redistributes the branch sites into OSPF and then R3 redistributes them back into RIP ie you would be advertising the branch routes back to the branchIt works the other way as well ie R3 redistributing into OSPF and R1 redistributing back into EIGRPSo both R1 and R3 would have to filter out the branch routes which may require tagging of routes2 you need to make sure the L3 switch sees the path via R1 as preferredThere are a number of ways of influencing the path eg redistribute with a higher metric on R3 increase the cost of the link connecting to R3 on the L3 switch etcA simpler solution might be possible using just two static routes but it depends on whether the branch will be using that internet connection for local internet access as well as the tunnel or just the tunnelIf it is just for the tunnel and you think it might be easier let me knowJon RVCE i didnt think of filtering the routesthanks for saving me from being an idiot by configuring the dmvpn straight awayyour solution of redistributing the rip or ospf routes with a higher metric on R3 looks better to menow there is no internet access to R2 except from head office MPLS linebut once DMVPN configured i want the internet junk to be out from DSL and only interesting traffic should be through MPLS RVCE No problemIf you want internet to be sent out locally then yes you need to use a routing protocol as you sayI cant think of anything else you need to think aboutHope it goes wellJon RVCE Thanks for spending your precious time for my issue and for the kind helponce i finish the configuration  i will update you RVCE No problem at all glad to helpIf you get any issues just post back into this threadJon RVCE Thank you very much Joninfact i was thinking on your suggestion of removing eigrp and configuring ospf for R2 then there will be no need for redistribution or metric change RVCE If you run OSPF over the main tunnel then you dont need to 1 modify the AD at the branch site2 you only have one point of redistribution ie R33 you dont need to modify metrics because the OSPF routes received by the L3 switch from R1 would be inter area whereas the routes received from R3 would be OSPF external routes because they have been redistributed from RIPThis still leaves the issue of redistribution though because R1 and R3 will still see each others OSPF routesSo you would need to filter the routes stillFiltering on R3 is straightforward because you are doing redistribution so you can pick which routes you advertise into RIPFiltering on R1 however is now a lot trickier because you are not doing redistributionWhat you may be able to do is make the branch site a stub area in which case the external routes will not be advertised which would be a clean solution as long as you dont have other external routes ie not the ones from R3 that you need to advertise to the branchWhat do you think Edit  sorry i am working this out as well  If you use a stub area then R1 as the ABR will also send a default route to the branch This isnt actually an issue because you can use a static default route at the branch site pointing to the internet link so it will be in your routing table and not the OSPF routeBut i just thought I should point that outJon RVCE Hi JonSorry i forgot to check CSC and the mail landed in junk so delay in replyand i am very thankful that you are working out it in lab for mei am getting confused hereas your first 3 points i can understandbut the point to filter the routesif i configure ospf on R2 in same area as R1 and L3 the routes from R2 will be intra areaO and the routes from R3 will be External Type 2E2 routesand L3 ospf routing table will have the best path L3R1R2 onlystill i need route filtering please guide me RVCE You dont want to put R1 and R2 into the same areaIf you do then you are going to have problems filteringYou still need filtering because you are going to run RIP on R3 This means you will have to redistribute OSPF into RIP and RIP into OSPF on R3But R1 is receiving routes from R2 via OSPF and these would get to R3 and you dont want R3 advertising those routes back to R2There are two solutions as far as I can see 1 if you want to avoid any filtering then run RIP between R3 and your L3 switchThis way there is no redistribution to be done anywhereYou may still want to put the branch into a different area as this is a recommended design for OSPF with DMVPN2 the one I proposed in my last post Here you would need to do filtering but only on R3R1 and R2 should be in different areas The issue with this is that OSPF externals will be coming from R3 To stop R1 sending these back to R2 you can make R2s area a stub area and these areas do not get sent OSPF externalsThis would work well as long as there are not other OSPF external routes ie routes not from R3 that R2 needs to know aboutLike I say R2 would also receive a default route from R1 but it doesnt matter because you are going to have a static default route on R2 pointing to the internet connection so the OSPF one wouldnt be usedThe second solution does do route redistribution and filtering but only on R3Does this make sense If its still not clear then by all means come backJon

BGP Failover Traffic Flow issue,Hello all I currently have an issue with my BGP failover configuration Current setup I have 2 Different ISPs going to 2 Different buildings One public address space given 24 BGP fail over is configured through inside as no Point to Point connection exists yet GRE tunnel has been created from the inside WAN router connects to Firewall Outside that has a No Nat for WAN loop back This then traverses through the inside core of building one to building to and out the Firewall to WAN router on Building 2 Currently when BGP fails over the traffic goes through building 1 to WAN 1 and sees the ISP down then sends traffic to the other side of tunnel to WAN 2 But seems like that traffic is Degraded and speeds are very low Is this because it is going through the GRE tunnel at this point would it just make sense to create an IP SLA and action script to have everything route to Second building and out I did notice the Tunnels showing bandwidth 100Kbits,Hello post a schematic drawing of what your setup looks like in addition to the relevant configurations RVCE What is the reason you have these tunnels Please remember to rate useful posts by clicking on the stars below

Eigrp stubsite and stub,In named eigrp are stubsite and stub options allowed See bold below,Hello not really sure what you are asking Those commands are certainly allowed with EIGRP virtual instance names Check this example httpwwwciscocomcenustddocsiosxmliosiprouteeigrpconfiguration15mtire15mtbookireiwansimplhtmltask986397932350786969615255983807268 RVCE Hi The eigrp stubsite command is mutually exclusive with the eigrp stub command You cannot execute both commands on a device It is also worth saying that this eigrp stubsite command resets the peers on WAN interfaces and initiates relearning of routes from WAN neighbors I hope this helps

OSPF  Summary Routes and ECMP,Hey Cisco ForumIm running a lab for some routing simulations and have come across some weird route summarization that I cant work out an answer to My lab looks like this from a routing perspective at leastBGP1 Palo Alto FWOSPF Pid120OSPFPid10 N9kBGP23725 Router BGP1 Palo Alto FWOSPF Pid120OSPFPid10 N9kBGP23725 Router Without summarization I get ECMP across each AS giving me L3 equal cost load balancing to all the right networks However when I summarise the routes I lose the ECMP I aggregate the routes in BGP1 and I see the aggregated routes in OSPF process 120 on both Nexus switch A and Nexus switch B OSPF process 120 redistributes into OSPF 10 OSPF 10 redistributes into BGP2 Thing is when I aggregate my routes on BGP1 by the time those routes hit BGP 2 through OSPF120 and OSPF10 BGP2 no longer sees equal cost path As soon as I disable the aggregate route my equal cost path returns Does anyone know why this is I dont understand Ive been reading up online and I cant seem to figure out why it is None of my OSPF config changes only that the external route its learned from BGP1 is a 17 instead of 3 24s The aggregation happens in BGP as an export on the Palo Alto firewall so its just another external network as far as OSPF is concerned I dont understand why I lose the ECMP and its bugging the heck outta me Thanks in advance all I can upload configs if its needed but I have a sneaky suspicion that its something glaringly obvious Im missing At least I hope it is Best Dan Solved Go to Solution,Morning Guys I moved my LAB configuration into a live datacentre over the weekend with some interesting results I upgraded the code on a VPC pair of NXOS 9ks from nxos703I23 to nxos703I71 My GNS3 Lab was running VM instances on nxos703I51 Adding layer3 peerrouter configuration under the VPC domain on the I7 version of code on the physical hardware didnt show the FA anomaly I was seeing on the OSPF LSAs in the virtual environment running I5 To conclude version I5 of code on the 9ks doesnt quite support Layer3 over VPC in the way it should I7 seems a more stable version of code for L3 over VPC On VM instances at least Ive no hardware running I5 and will likely upgrade my remaining 9ks straight to I7 Thanks all for your help and advice Best Dan RVCE Hello curious Can you post the output of show ip bgp topology  for both the aggregate and

that and thanks for supplying the link Ill do some digging to see if I can see why the LSA has a nonzero forwarding address on NXOSCore2 Thanks again Dan RVCE Hey Guys I fired up the lab yesterday and fixed the routing issues I was seeing in the OSPF process Adding a Layer3 pointtopoint link across the vPC for OSPF process 10 and OSPF process 120 corrected the LSA advertisements and FA Despite having layer3 peerrouter on the vPC domain L3 routing information wasnt being shared over the vPC Turns out it wasnt an issue contained to a summary address rather affecting all LSAs regardless of summary or not Only that having the summary and running a failover scenario was where I first spotted the loss of ECMP Either my OSPF topology is wrong for a vPC as far as I can tell from Brad Hedlunds blog Ive got it right or Layer 3 over vPC isnt quite working in NXOS 703I51 My guess is the version of code isnt quite there yet for Layer over vPC Thanks all for your help and advice  got there in the end Thanks Dan RVCE Morning Guys I moved my LAB configuration into a live datacentre over the weekend with some interesting results I upgraded the code on a VPC pair of NXOS 9ks from nxos703I23 to nxos703I71 My GNS3 Lab was running VM instances on nxos703I51 Adding layer3 peerrouter configuration under the VPC domain on the I7 version of code on the physical hardware didnt show the FA anomaly I was seeing on the OSPF LSAs in the virtual environment running I5 To conclude version I5 of code on the 9ks doesnt quite support Layer3 over VPC in the way it should I7 seems a more stable version of code for L3 over VPC On VM instances at least Ive no hardware running I5 and will likely upgrade my remaining 9ks straight to I7 Thanks all for your help and advice Best Dan
Portchannel one side L3 interface and other side L2 interface,Hi All Pleas refer the attached diagram I have a requirement to create redundancy between a 6509 and an ASR1k which acts as a server by having 2 physical links between them Also I will have to use an IP from the existing vlan in 6509 VLAN100 Is it possible to bundle them using portchannel and then configure IP only at router end of the portchannel Switch end of the portchannel will act as Layer2 port channel as shown in the diagram Or is there any other good solution that you can suggest ThanksRaghavendra,Hi Unfortunately it is not possible on portchannel both ends must be have the same configuration Is this SVI 100 on the 6509 used for other role or just to connect with the ASR RVCE Thank you Julio Yes SVI 100 is used as default gateway for a set of users One IP from vlan 100 subnet needs to be sued to extend connectivity to this ASR router Is there any other option like creating BVI interface in ASR router  RVCE Any other solution for this requirement  How about BVI  Can I terminate it on a BVI interface of ASR router RVCE I think your original solution should work fine although I have never used that setup with an ASR I have used a similar setup in the past where the 6500 was running CatOS which meant you could not configure L3 physical ports so you configured a L2 etherchannel with the physical ports in a vlan and then have an SVI for that vlan on the 6500 just as you are proposing The other end of the link was a L3 etherchannel and it worked fine Jon RVCE Thank you JonWe tried testing it in a GNS setup but it didnt work How about creating a BVI interface on the router will it work  RVCE Havent tried that What part did not work ie did the etherchannel not come up or did it not pass traffic  I have definitely used that setup before but it was between switches at both ends so it looks like Julio may well be right Jon RVCE In GNS3 portchannel itself is not coming up when we have IP address at one end When it is Layer2 at both the end and Layer3 at both the end portchannel is coming up RVCE Did you set both ends to on  I know it works between switches because I have done it and advised people on this forum that it works and they have confirmed it so perhaps it is to do with the ASR Apologies for misleading information Jon RVCE Hey No worries your inputs will definitely help I will try again by making it on at both the end

combined and redundant mode for power supplies in 45006500 ,Hi every bodyI have few questionscombined modeLet me quote from my cisco press book If one power supply fails in combined mode the switch powers down some of its modules until the required power load can be met by one functioning power supplyHow does switch determine which modules power be turned off firstRedundant modeHow can we determine which power supply is suppling power to modules in switchIs it power supply 1 or 2thanks a lot Solved Go to Solution,You are indeed correct and I should amend my last sentence my last sentence is only true in combined mode not redundant  my apologies  long day  According to the link I posted on the 4500Redundant modeRedundant mode uses one power supply as a primary power supply and the second power supply as a backup If the primary power supply fails the second power supply immediately supports the switch without any disruption in the network Both power supplies must be the same wattage A single power supply must have enough power to support the switch configuration HTHEdison RVCE How about some graphical images httpwwwciscocomenUSdocsswitcheslancatalyst6500hardwareChassisInstallationCat650001overhtmlHTHEdison RVCE How does switch determine which modules power be turned off first It goes from the bottom module to the top module with the exception of the Supervisor module thats turned off lastThe above behavior is only seen during bootup not while adding modules in a running switchIf you have a running switch and try to insert a module which exceeds power requirement the module wont be turned on and current working modules wont be turned off Here is a good link on the 4500 modelhttpwwwciscocomenUSdocsswitcheslancatalyst450012231sgaconfigurationguidepwrenvrhtmlwp1035469As for the redundant mode a module isnt drawing from a specific power supply its drawing power from both at the same timeHTHEdison RVCE Thanks Edison Let me quote from my cisco pres book By default a switch is configured for redundant mode If two power supplies are installed and functioningthey are managed as redundant replacements for each otherBoth supplies are enabled and activeas if they were both supplying power In fact you probably wont be abl to tell which supply is actually powering the switch until one one of them is turned off or failIt appears to me one of the supplies is providing power to switchs modules RVCE You are indeed correct and I should amend my last sentence my last sentence is only true in combined mode not redundant  my apologies  long day  According to the link I posted on the 4500Redundant modeRedundant mode uses one power supply as a primary power supply and the second power supply as a backup If the primary power supply fails the second power supply immediately supports the switch without any disruption in the network Both power supplies must be the same wattage A single power supply must have enough power to support the switch configuration HTHEdison RVCE Apology accepted Edison Thanks a lot EdisonNow the question is how can we determine which power supply is powering the switch and which one is on backupI saw in book  the power supplies are numbered as 1 and 2 How can we determine which power supply is designated as 1 which power supply is designated as 2 Jon says though he admits he is not surelooking at the back of chassis the left one is number 1 and right one is number 2Any suggestioncorrectionthanks a lot RVCE Hi EdisonI find conflicting material about redundant mode Below is the linkhttpenwikipediaorgwikiCatalyst65006503I quote from the linkRedundant ModeWhen running in Redundant Mode each power supply provides approximately 50 of its capacity to the chassis In the event of a failure the unaffected power supply will then provide 100 of its capacity and an alert will be generated As there was enough to power the chassis ahead of time there is no interruption to service in this configuration This is also the default and recommended way to configure power suppliesedit Combined ModeIn combined mode each power supply provides approximately 83 of its capacity to the chassis This allows for greater utilisation of the power supplies and potentially increased PoE densitiesIn the event of a failure we power down all devices except the supervisor During this time there will be a temporary network outage while we return power to the system The order at which we do this is as follows 1 First we power up service modules from the top down 2 Then we power up line cards from the top most slot to the bottom most We do not permit PoE at this stage 3 Next we power up PoE from the highest line card and the highest port ie line card 0port 0 down through to the lowestWe go through the above until we have hit our power capacity of the remaining power Normally a single power supply will be able to power all service modules and line cards but not give the PoE densities requiredthanks a lot RVCE Hi SarahIts not conflicting materialMy previous post reflected only the 4500 I missed that you were also targeting the 6500 Series which is a different animal altogetherThe 6500 does draw power from both power supplieshttpwwwciscocomenUSdocsswitcheslancatalyst6500ios122SXconfigurationguidepwrenvrhtmlTo disable or enable redundancy redundancy is enabled by default from global configuration mode enter the power redundancymode combined  redundant commands You can change the configuration of the power supplies to redundant or nonredundant at any timeTo disable redundancy use the combined keyword In a nonredundant configuration the power available to the system is the combined power capability of both power supplies The system powers up as many modules as the combined capacity allows However if one power supply fails and there is not enough power for all of the previously poweredup modules the system powers down those modulesTo enable redundancy use the redundant keyword In a redundant configuration the total power drawn from both power supplies is not greater than the capability of one power supply If one supply malfunctions the other supply can take over the entire system load When you install and power up two power supplies each concurrently provides approximately half of the required power to the system Load sharing and redundancy are enabled automatically no software configuration is required HTHEdison RVCE Hello Edison my customer has a 6509E with 2 WSCAC6000 power

OSPF basic question,We have a datcentre A and B and each datacentre is connected with a single WAN router BGP is configured on both WAN router with service provider OSPF is configured between router and both data centres We want that traffic originate from datacentre B should through datacentre A WAN If the WAN fails then it should take data centre B WANOn datacentre A Router default route is redistributed into OSPF with metric 1 and on datcentre B router default route is redistributed with metric 5 So the metric is configred for the route My question is what does this metric is doing metric 1 means more preferred path will it add cost as well does it has to do with E1 or E2 secondly what if i configure cost on the linksIf I configure cost on the links will it do the same thing secondly i have seen some configuration in which router Ethernet cost is configured as 2 but from switch to same router and interface cost is configured 5 i always thought it should be same why its done like that Thanks guys,Hello from your description I cannot figure out how both datacentres are connected Can you post a schematic drawing

How does Router Know which interface should be forward multicast packet such as hello packet ospf,Dear AllHow does Router Know which interface should be use to forward multicast packet such as hello packet ospf thank you very much Solved Go to Solution,Regarding OSPF specifically the router knows because you have told it to do that eg if you have an interface with an IP address 19216851 and you have this config router ospf 10network 19216851 0000 area 0 then the router starts up OSPF on that interface and begins sending hello packets out of that interface The more general question of multicast packets is a much bigger one With pim dense mode the router will simply flood multicast packets out of all interfaces except the interface it received it on It is then up to routers further downstream to tell the originating router whether it wants to receive those packets ie it has members who want to receive the multicast stream or whether it doesnt With pim sparse mode it doesnt flood the packet it informs the RP Rendevous Point If another router has members attached to it that want to receive the packets then it has to tell the RP Rendevous Point that it wants to receive the packets and then it is sent them The RP is a router that you designate for the multicast network Multicast routers using Cisco PIM use the existing IP routing table to forward multicast packets The above is a very brief outline and there is a lot more to multicast than that Have a read of this link and if you have further questions please come back  httpwwwciscocomenUScustomerdocsiossolutionsdocsipmulticastWhitepapersmcstovrhtmlEdit  pay particular attention to the RPF section which describes how multicast uses the IP routing tableJon RVCE Hi224005224006 are linklocal multicast addresses with a TTL of 1 so the routers will never forward them even if it is doing multicast routingRegardsAlainDont forget to rate helpful posts Dont forget to rate helpful posts RVCE Regarding OSPF specifically the router knows because you have told it to do that eg if you have an interface with an IP address 19216851 and you have this config router ospf 10network 19216851 0000 area 0 then the router starts up OSPF on that interface and begins sending hello packets out of that interface The more general question of multicast packets is a much bigger one With pim dense mode the router will simply flood multicast packets out of all interfaces except the interface it received it on It is then up to routers further downstream to tell the originating router whether it wants to receive those packets ie it has members who want to receive the multicast stream or whether it doesnt With pim sparse mode it doesnt flood the packet it informs the RP Rendevous Point If another router has members attached to it that want to receive the packets then it has to tell the RP Rendevous Point that it wants to receive the packets and then it is sent them The RP is a router that you designate for the multicast network Multicast routers using Cisco PIM use the existing IP routing table to forward multicast packets The above is a very brief outline and there is a lot more to multicast than that Have a read of this link and if you have further questions please come back  httpwwwciscocomenUScustomerdocsiossolutionsdocsipmulticastWhitepapersmcstovrhtmlEdit  pay particular attention to the RPF section which describes how multicast uses the IP routing tableJon RVCE Dear Mr JonI make an ospf topology like this then I try to debug Ospf hello on Router 3 i think i should see hello packet from Router 1 toosince hello packet used multicast address But I Cant see hello packet From R1 on router R3 What would Router OSPF do when they received hello packet from their neighbour do they forward that hello packet to other neighbour or just listen it RVCE Hi224005224006 are linklocal multicast addresses with a TTL of 1 so the routers will never forward them even if it is doing multicast routingRegardsAlainDont forget to rate helpful posts Dont forget to rate helpful posts RVCE Hi Alain Thanks for this information it really helped RVCE HelloJust like to add Ospf hello packets are used to confirm a bidirectional communication between opsf neighbors so regards your topology hello packets will be seen between R1  R2  R3  R2 not between R1  R3 resPaulPlease dont forget to rate any posts that have been helpful Thanks Please dont forget to rate any posts that have been helpfulThanks RVCE Just to add to Alains reply All 22400x addresses are link local Routing protocols such as RIPEIGRP and OSPF as you have seen use 22400x addressing as do other protocols These are never routed In terms of OSPF they are only used to form neighborships as Paul said and you can only have a neighbor on the same subnet so there is no need for them to be passed to another OSPF routerJon

Routing Selection  Packet Forwarding,I am getting some conflicting info when looking up how a cisco router chooses the best route to get a packet to its destination I believe what I am reading says that when a router gets a packet from a source destined to 100150  sees multiple routes to destination 100150 it will use the route with the lowest AD number first If 2 of the routes to the same destination have the same AD number the router will check which path has the best metric  choose that route first And last if all AD numbers are the same  no metrics are defined the router will choose the route with the most specific prefix first Does this make sense I also heard the route with the lowest AD always gets picked first no matter what  if the AD numbers are the same the route with the most specific prefix gets picked second Please Help Solved Go to Solution,Hello longest prefix goes first then comes administrative distance then metric RVCE Hello longest prefix goes first then comes administrative distance then metric

Upgrading WAN do we still need ISR routers,Hi there apologies for what may be a dumb question  but I was just wondering if this may be possible We currently have a WAN where our remote sites are connecting using 4331 and 4321 ISR routersWe use BGP for our routing protocol with route maps and a prefix list to give preference where some networks are available on multiple WAN links For QOS we are using NBAR2 for classification  with some custom entries and DSCP marking based on our class maps populated by nbar2 protocols This seems to be working pretty well but we are in the process of centralization and we may be beefing some of our links up considerably to 500 mbit or 1 gbit in some cases According to the ISR throughput info i have found we would need to go to the 4431 for 500 Mbit  1 Gbit sites and 4331 for the 100 Mbit sites At the same time as this we may be looking to refresh some of our old switching at these sites currently ancient 3750s in a VSS If we were to replace these stacks with the 9300 series catalyst routers  would we be able to perform the same QOS  Routing functionality on those rather than purchasing another ISR as well We also have a couple of 4500 series chassis at our DC with SUP8 modules in them would that also be able to handle a 1 gbit link and apply those same L3 functionalities on a routed WAN port Solved Go to Solution,Cisco L3 switches especially LAN L3 switches dont often support shapers or NBAR RVCE Do the routers handle NAT or not RVCE No they dont perform any NAT at all RVCE Generally L3 switches are feature poor compared to ISRs Leo touched on one such feature NAT but L3 switches have less capable QoS many dont support tunnels or tunnels with encryption etc It really depends on your needs Ie L3 switches might be just fine or they may not be BTW when looking at switches MetroE switches often offer a few additional features not found on LAN switchesA 4500 sup8 can easily handle gig or even 10g capacity wise Again you may find it missing features found on an ISRThe Catalyst 9300 at this time is a bit of an unknown It does whatever it does now but with its newer ASICs additional features may appear later Ideally see if you can discuss its roadmap with Cisco on a NDA basis RVCE Thanks Joseph Yes thats why I was asking about the QOS would it support using NBAR2 to put specific protocols into classmaps and apply DSCP markings that way with a shape average parent policy as that is how we are doing it currently and that will suffice RVCE Cisco L3 switches especially LAN L3 switches dont often support shapers or NBAR
HO to DR bandwidth,Dears I have been given a task to decide the bandwidth from HO to DR the bandwidth is decided on basis of what  everyday in GBs  around 10 to 15 GB traffic will be passed from HO to DR so how i shld calculate the bandwidth requirement so that i can ask ISP for the same is it been calculated on type of traffic or on amount of data  like in GBs Thanks Solved Go to Solution, 45 GB is about 4600 MB 45 x 1024 4600 MB is about 36800 Mbit 4600 x 8In a best case scenario it would then take 736 seconds 36800 Mbit  50 Mbits to download the file so the file will be downloaded in 12 minsI calculate the same although again remember you need to allow for L2 and L3 and L4 overheads so I would add about 25 to your 12 minutes have put the maths here where in case I know the bandwidth 50Mbs and I get the answers in seconds which further we divide by 60 for min and further by 60 to get hrs but what abt if we know the seconds and we have to calculate bandwidth Okay taking your example what if we need to move your 45 GB in two minutes As you noted you have 36800 Mbit to move but again in two minutes Two minutes is 120 seconds so if we divide 36800 by 120 that will gives us about 307 Mbps RVCE Hello 1015GB in what amount of time  During a normal business day 9 to 5  RVCE this is for the schedule backup and that will be in the night RVCE For a scheduled backup you find the amount of bytes you need to move within what timeframe and then allow for overhead and other traffic That will reveal the amount of bandwidth you need RVCE Dear Joseph Can you do a simple match for explanation  so that it will be clear understanding thanks RVCE SureLets assume you need to backup 100 GBytes Thats 800 gigabits If your time window was 8 hours you would need to move 100 gigabits an hour payload or divide by 3600 about 28 Mbps Considering L2 and L3 overhead and if using TCP TCPs typical sawtooth transmission rate add about 25 So you would need a link that could provide about 35 Mbps for 8 hours RVCE Dear Joseph Lets assume you need to backup 100 GBytes Thats 800 gigabits If your time window was 8 hours you would need to move 100 gigabits an hour I understood the above maths but I didnt understood this maths payload or divide by 3600 about 28 Mbps can u elaborate more in 2 scenarios how we can calculate bandwidth and the another scenario to how calculate time if we have the know bandwidth thanks RVCE Hello on a side note you can use the bandwidthtime calculator linked below httpwintelguycomwanperfpl RVCE Ok if you understand 100 gigabits an hour what thats per secondThere are 60 minutes per hour and 60 seconds per minuted 60  60  3600If you know the bandwidth you can calculate the inverse Say you have 10 Mbps That 125 MBytess or 75 MB in a minute or 45 GB an hourIf I havent addressed your questions let me know RVCE Dear Joseph U r super bronze but not me so please bare with me I really still didnt understood your maths I am not able to do the inverse can u help me with simple maths as what I described below if we aware of the bandwidth I have put the maths here where in case I know the bandwidth 50Mbs and I get the answers in seconds which further we divide by 60 for min and further by 60 to get hrs but what abt if we know the seconds and we have to calculate bandwidth  45 GB is about 4600 MB 45 x 1024 4600 MB is about 36800 Mbit 4600 x 8 In a best case scenario it would then take 736 seconds 36800 Mbit  50 Mbits to download the file so the file will be downloaded in 12 mins RVCE  45 GB is about 4600 MB 45 x 1024 4600 MB is about 36800 Mbit 4600 x 8In a best case scenario it would then take 736 seconds 36800 Mbit  50 Mbits to download the file so the file will be downloaded in 12 minsI calculate the same although again remember you need to allow for L2 and L3 and L4 overheads so I would add about 25 to your 12 minutes have put the maths here where in case I know the bandwidth 50Mbs and I get the answers in seconds which further we divide by 60 for min and further by 60 to get hrs but what abt if we know the seconds and we have to calculate bandwidth Okay taking your example what if we need to move your 45 GB in two minutes As you noted you have 36800 Mbit to move but again in two minutes Two minutes is 120 seconds so if we divide 36800 by 120 that will gives us about 307 Mbps

WAAS,i need to know ASR routers support WAAS solution or not ,
One tunnel subnet two hubs a colocation facility and SNMPc monitoring dilemma,Hi Cisco Gurus I have a bit of a dilemma here I hope someone can provide some guidance on Essentially we have remotes that have two hubs and are multihomed with MPLS primary and VPN backup The Western remotes primarily go to the Western hub with the Eastern as backup and vice versa The issue is the remotes are all using the same 23 subnet for the tunnels and we want to be able to see when a Western hub VPN connection goes down to its primary hub and when an Eastern remote goes down to its Eastern hub The SNMPc poller is at our colocation facility If we advertise the 23 at both hubs to our COLO facility for monitoring purposes COLO routing will of course only take one hub or the other to the mentioned 23 So monitoring will only be valid for one hub and its associated remotes primary VPN path and the other hubs remotes secondary VPN path but not primary I know you can obviously split the 23 up into two 24 subnets but is there another method I see routeinjection as a possibility The problem that occurs with routeinjection is on the MPLS primaries to COLO the next hop is always the MPLS GW of the ISP so you cant differentiate between one hub or the other to inject a smaller subnet from Or can you Any other methods to solve this problem Anything Im missing Thanks in advance,What routing protocol are you usingI think I would SNMP monitoring the routing protocol peers on the hubs RVCE Ideal but not an option at this time RVCE Forgot to update I did find a solution to this I split the slash23 up into two 24s ONLY in a static route for monitoring purposes at our colocation facility Anything from our SNMP server destined for the two 24 subnets are being directed towards the respective far side hub tunnel IPs next hops Works well Only problem is if the COLO tunnel to the hubs goes down all the respective remotes would go down as well in terms of MONITORING Now I have recently noticed my NMS Castlerock does have an option for what they call dependencies From what I can tell you can define that if a certain polled IP goes down do not alert for this remote Havent tried it though Also this was the normal process anyways from the COLO end prior to the changes If the COLO DMVPN went down so did ALL associated remotes backup routes as well as monitoring So its not a new behavior its just that their are NOW two all remotes down failure points for monitoring One actual and one false in that the connection down to COLO is only monitoring and DR whilst the down via the hubs to the COLO is monitoring for sure but could also falsely suggest the hub to remote tunnel went down at the hub You would have to check if the hub tunnel is up or had bounced as a new standard procedure Not a big deal but not ideal either

ASA cannot ping outside through NAT on border router,I have the following topology below in GNS3 Basically the cloud NAT1 is the Internet R1 is my border router with NAT and FWASAv1 was supposed to be able to access the Internet but cant I created that other leg with R2 to test the NAT and to my surprise that one works fine Here is the relevant config R1 R2FWASAv1debug in R1 debug ip natI also captured traffic between R1 and Switch1 When ping comes from R2 packets show up there already translated When pinged from ASA no icmp packets show up thereIs it something in ASA I dont know what else to do I can provide more configurations debug what not Solved Go to Solution,Hello on a side note and looking at your topology are you using the IOSv appliance for the routers  I think the ASAv and IOS routers in GNS are not working well together you need to use the IOSv appliance I have attached the topology I am using in GNS3 with the exact same configs you have posted and I can ping 8888 from the ASA outside interface RVCE Hello fws by default provide a way to proxy from one network to another nowadays they are statefull meaning they monitor connections from inside your network to outside or vice versa if they are allowed to but usually only connections initiated from inside to outside are allowed so ypur inside interface security level 100 will allow traffic out or outside interface security level 0 but not the other way around NVI is a nat virtual interface used in domainless nat  it created automatically when when nat is enabled  domain or domainless but my understanding it’s only used in domainless nat  ip nat enable  so no need for ip nat inside  ip nat outside in your case regards your topology can a few things are not correct 1 you don’t have nat enabled on the asa and as the rtr that’s is attached to the Asa’s outside interface isn’t aware of the Asa’s internal networks then connectivity will fail so ether enable nat on the asa or add some static routes in rtr 1 to make it aware of the asa internal networks 2 also you nat acl on rtr 1 should not use any any but be specific about what networks need to be translated as this can put a unwarranted load on the router and also could result in network issues res paul Please dont forget to rate any posts that have been helpfulThanks RVCE Hello Paul So traffic is not going through the ASA yet Im trying to use the ASA outside interface as source As you can see in the debug the source address for the ASA ping is in fact the one from the outside interface which is directly connected to R1 so no need for static routes My understanding is that traffic should go through R1 which would NAT it to the Internet as it is happening with R2 So my traffic is not coming from ASA inside interface it is being originated in ASA outside interface It looks like R1 is being selective and only NATing R2 traffic I know I am missing something Im just not sure what RVCE Hello I am pretty sure this is a bug in GNS3 In VIRL ping works right away without a default route or any icmp permit statements on the ASA The default configuration just has icmp inspect in the global policy and I am not sure even that is required I have tried about everything in GNS3 but I couldnt get it to work either Some threads suggest to turn off CPU throttling in the Advanced settings of the ASAv template you might want to give that a try RVCE Hello I am quite sure this isnt a bug Now initiating a ping from the ASA FW itself without any NAT applied on the ASA FW or RTR1 should succeed in a reply from 8888 providing you have the correct routing inplace However as you have NAT applied to RTR1 then this problem could be due to the way the NAT order of operation occurs between the two nat domains  insideoutside in legacy nat Would be interesting to see if you used domainless NAT  NVI instead of legacy nat and retested your ping from the ASA RTR1 remove ip nat insideoutside from your interfaces and apply ip nat enableno ip nat inside source list 1 interface fa01 overload no accesslist 1 accesslist 100 ip permit 17216310 000255 anyaccesslist 100 ip permit 10000 000255 anyip nat source list 100 interface fa01 overload ip route 9000 0 0000 f01 dhcp res Paul Please dont forget to rate any posts that have been helpfulThanks RVCE Hello Paul I must have NAT on R1 so I can PAT traffic out since that PAT interface is the only known address by the NAT node Otherwise with routing only if traffic comes from the inside interfaceconnected network that source IP will not have a returning path As Georg pointed out it was something to do with GNS3 and how it virtualizes devices now I replied below But thanks a lot for responding you guys helped a lot RVCE Hello on a side note and looking at your topology are you using the IOSv appliance for the routers  I think the ASAv and IOS routers in GNS are not working well together you need to use the IOSv appliance I have attached the topology I am using in GNS3 with the exact same configs you have posted and I can ping 8888 from the ASA outside interface RVCE Oh my I cant believe that I redid my topology with the IOSv image and now ASA can reach outside and so my intranet on the inside network from ASA point of view I cant believe dynamips has gone down hill like that so now every piece of device in GNS3 must be virtualized with KVM or docker Thank you for your heads up

C8194G Connectivity issues,Hello all Trying to get this 4G router up and running but its not going well I used CCP Exress to set it up and it works for the most part but only on EDGE1X and 3G at extremely slow speeds It never negotiates its way to 4G and if manually set to be 4G only it wont connect to verizon as it doesnt bring up any of the profiles Signal is not the issue as its going through a large antenna and an amplifier SIM card is good works in 4G LTE stick from Verizon this is what I pulled the sim out of and talking with Verizon there is no lock on the card and everything seems good on their end Not sure what to do now I would really like to use this router over the other solution I rigged up with a PFsense router and the USB stick let me know what info you would need from me Any help is fully appreciatedThanks,Here is the out put of the sh cell 0 all and sh run httpspastebincomVvEYH0xf in the mean time ive erased my config and started again the new config is whats in the paste bin still getting the same issue setting it to auto lte technology gets connected but extremely slow and forcing LTE it just sits RVCE Hello before anything else you need to configure your NAT Add the lines in bold to your config interface Vlan1 description ETHSWLAUNCHINTFINFOHWIC 4ESW ip address 1010101 255255255248 ip nat inside ip tcp adjustmss 1452 ip nat inside source list 23 interface Cellular0 overload RVCE OK put the lines in the config then copied it back over from TFTP into start and then reloaded the unit it moved the last command down a few lines but its there does it matter too much where things are located in the config as long as related things are together Im pretty new to Cisco in general but am quickly picking up on the basic commands and can get around a little bit sadly those commands given havent made a difference yet but i assume that this tells the router that the cell 0is the internet and that vlan 1 is my lan The unit is still failing to attach any profiles in both modes now whereas in auto mode it would below are the readouts from running sh cell 0 all the first one is when I leave it in auto mode and the second one is the output of when I force it to run in LTE only mode Note that the signal is a bit weaker today since its snowing right now and ive seen that play with the signal before on other devices but it should not be hurting it

but it pinged and got an ip address so it at least works at this point with your config i think the config side is good but I think the problem Im having is that the modem settings are stored in the modem pretty sure and for some reason there is something in there that is holding it up on LTE mode One of the first guides I saw and messed around with was this about a week ago  httpsnetworkingbodgesblogspotcouk201409configuringbasic4glteconnectivityhtml  in the post his is in LTE mode when set to auto so im starting to wonder if i need to do like a full reset on the modem it self or just grab all the configs off the unit and do a full reset on the whole thing and see if it clears things up or my modem is just slightly fried in which case im not sure what to do Just for best results i have the amplifier in line with the system now to completely rule out the idea that its bad signal i do only get two bars on my phone so its not the best but now the readings for the 4G RSSI is in the 60s so its excellent signal Thanks for all your help so far I really appreciate it RVCE Hello what exactly do you mean wiith lte mode and auto mode  RVCE You can issue a command at the CLI for cell 0 lte tech auto or cell 0 lte tech ltethat sets the radio communication if i leave mine it auto its borderline useless it wont talk its way up to anything higher that EDGE 1X or barely 3G why i think that the config does not handle how the radio talks is there doesnt seem to be any lines in the config about it and you dont need to go into config mode to set it So when I say forced LTE mode I ran the second command to lock the radio into only trying to use LTE RVCE Hello so you configure this under the controller To be honest I have never seen anyone configuring the controller in auto mode it should work most of the time Just to be sure can you post your current full config so I can check if everything is configured correctly  We might change the MTU settings RVCE yep by default it comes on auto mode im not playing with it using conf  controller cell 0 im just running the commands straight from the enabled CLI and ive attached the config exactly as pulled of the unit with tftp to my laptop made txt for upload sorry for the delayed response got busy yesterday RVCE Hello I would do the following 1 Reset the router to factory defaults hold the reset button for 10 seconds whike powering on the router 2 Enter the entire configuration manually Check if that makes a difference RVCE Hello just wanted to give you an update since youve been helping me currently this project is going on hold for a while After trying your last tips ive pulled the Modem card out of the cisco and have since hooked it up to my laptop directly with a usb adapter turns out the modem cards in these things are just USB over Mini PCIE and its still showing the exact same issues searching around has found that some of these modems have a bad firmware on them that causes the exact issue im having So card is basically useless currently looking at getting a newer model of the same series and will either use that directly or try putting it in the cisco and see what that does RVCE

When do we implement Static Routing,HelloA newbie here I have tried to search in google on this but I cannot find the answer to my questionI hope you can help me and shed some light Your expert advise will be of great help heres my question1 When do we implement static routing 2 or what are the instances that we need to use this2 If I wanted to share filesother resources to remote office is configuring static routing will workThank you in advanceSugar Solved Go to Solution,SugarIt depends The static route only lets the router know how to get to a certain subnet The server thats sharing resources will be on a subnet and the router on the other side will need to know how to get to it It wouldnt control if files could be shared or not though Example Lets say that you have 2 routers 19216810 and 19216820 The routers connect on 101010030 All of your users are in 19216810 and your servers are in 19216820 You have a web and ftp server at address 192168250 19216810 RouterA 1010101  1010102 RouterB 19216820The routers dont know about each others internal subnets Without a routing protocol advertising them theyll need some way to know how to get to the other subnet Youll need 2

tells the router how to get to the other subnetHTHJohn HTH John  Please rate all useful posts  RVCE SugarIt is difficult to make absolute statements that static routing will always work because some situations are different and may impact the use of static routing But in general it is safe to assume that you could use static routing to be able to share files and things like thatI would explain it in this way in general we can assume that static routing works and that it is the most simple and basic level of establishing network connectivity It is almost always available and is the fall back position when we choose not to use dynamic routing protocols in general we can assume that dynamic routing protocols are an alternative to static routing and that dynamic routing protocols offer some advantages over static routingSo the question becomes what are the advantages of dynamic routing and when we might choose dynamic routing protocols over static routing The advantages include if the number of routes in the network gets large it becomes an administrative burden to keep track of all of them and to manually configure all the routes I have a customer that has well over 2000 routes in their network and networks of that size would be extremely difficult to maintain static routes if there are more than one way to get to a destination and we want to choose the optimum path We might be able to do that with static routes but the dynamic routing protocol does it automatically and much more efficiently if we want to be able to react to changes that take place in the network I had a customer once who wanted to be very much in control of what happened in their network And their policy was to use only static routes Every time that a network connection went down they had to manually discover the problem and then to manually make changes to use a different path throgh the network I thought it was not very efficient but it did satisfy their desire to maintain great control over the network A dynamic routing protocol will automatically detect changes in link status in the network and will automatically make changes in the routing table to accommodate maintaining the optimum pathFrom what I understand from your other post it appears that your network is fairly small It may not have very many alternate paths to destinations and there may not be that many choices of how to find the path to the destinations So it sounds like static routing would be a satisfactory solution for youHTHRick RVCE SugarIf you dont have a pointtopoint connection to the other office or an MPLS connection through a provider and are only using standard internet connections youre going to need to implement IPSec tunnels to have the 2 locations talk to each other Its going to get a lot more complicated than just a static routeJohn HTH John  Please rate all useful posts  RVCE Sugar has another post asking about connecting the two offices and in that thread we pretty clearly suggested a site to site VPN was the solution that they need Use this link to see that threadhttpssupportforumsciscocommessage36397553639755Assuming that each office has a fairly small and simple topology and assuming that each office has a static IP then I believe that configuring a site to site VPN should be fairly straightforward And I believe that static routing is all that they need Each office may need some static routes for subnets within the office if there are subnets that are not locally connected on the main router and would need static routes for the subnets in the other office and would need a static default route to the Internet Service Provider I would think that this would be adequate for their needsBut as John points out it is more complicated than just configuring some static routes There needs to be a site to site VPN configured alsoHTHRick RVCE Hi11 When you have slow bandwidth links for example dialup because dynamic routing updates consume bandwidth12 When necessary to reach a network accessible by one path For example when router connects to ISP – you need have static default gateway to ISP or you have stub network13 When you have slow CPU or memory because dynamic protocols consume it2 You can use static route for add in routing table information about remote office for have connection remote officeI hope this information will be useful RVCE Hi SergeyThanks for your reply and help I just want to confirm if wanted to share files and other resources can this be achieved by configuring static routeAgain thank youSugar RVCE SugarIt depends The static route only lets the router know how to get to a certain subnet The server thats sharing resources will be on a subnet and the router on the other side will need to know how to get to it It wouldnt control if files could be shared or not though Example Lets say that you have 2 routers 19216810 and 19216820 The routers connect on 101010030 All of your users are in 19216810 and your servers are in 19216820 You have a web and ftp server at address 192168250 19216810 RouterA 1010101  1010102 RouterB 19216820The routers dont know about each others internal subnets Without a routing protocol advertising them theyll need some way to know how to get to the other subnet Youll need 2 static routes one on each routerOn RouterAip route 19216820 2552552550 1010102On RouterBip route 19216810 2552552550

Cisco 887VA ADSL router performance  Fiber Broadband etc,Hi AllWe use Cisco 887VA routers for ADSL I believe the throughput from the Cisco specs says it is sized for up to 15MbitIf this is the case what router would I use for some fiber broadband 50Mbit etc cheers,Hi Have a look at this ISR 4000 series comparison sheet it will tell you the expected performance of each model HTH RVCE Hello I think the 890 does 50MB
Suspected problem with BGP route advertisement,Hi there I am experiencing a problem which I suspect involves an issue with route advertisement The setup is as follows Device A 100154225 gateway 1001541Router A interface 1 100154125 interface 2 10015425029 interface 1 is connected to network with Device A interface 2 is connected to network with router B EIGRPRouter B interface 1 10015424929 interface 2 10015523429 interface 1 is connected to network with router A interface 2 is connected to network with router C BGP neighbor 100155233 router C EIGRP redistribute into BGPRouter C interface 10015523329 has routes to devices on 19216816427 and 19216836427 exact configuration unknown but assumed to be correct The ultimate requirement is that Device A is able to reach devices on 19216816427 and vice versa Only the routes required to reach this device are required to be advertised into the BGP table on 100155233 Both device A and router A successfully connect to 100155234 router B but cant connect to 100155233 router C or further Traceroute hops to 1001551 then 100155249 and stops here Router B reaches 100155233 router C and traceroute follows the router there as received over BGP Relevant config on router BConfig on router A Can some genius shed some light on whats going wrong Thanks in advance Solved Go to Solution,Youre missing defaultmetric in EIGRP config EIGRP does not redistribute BGP routes on R2 You need to set it in either of 3 ways redistribute command with routemap redistribute command with defaultmetric standalone defaultmetric EIGRP command RVCE There is another issue here as well Router A is not receiving the routes to 19216816427 and 19216836427 from router B over EIGRP even though redistribute bgp is enabled on router B This would not explain why 100155233 is inaccessible though RVCE Youre missing defaultmetric in EIGRP config EIGRP does not redistribute BGP routes on R2 You need to set it in either of 3 ways redistribute command with routemap redistribute command with defaultmetric standalone defaultmetric EIGRP command RVCE Thank you Michal The problem is now partially resolved I can confirm that adding a defaultmetric solved the route redistribution problem Im receiving all the BGP entries over EIGRP now but Im still unable to reach 100155233 I suspect that this issue which is the big problem is related to the BGP configuration itself The route to it is advertised over EIGRP because I can see it in the routing table and I can reach the router on 100155234 I think that the router at 100155233 doesnt have a route back to the rest of the network yet it shows in the advertisedroutes table Unfortunately I have no access to that router so I cannot look at the tables there I can only troubleshoot it from the other end RVCE Post the updated config of both A  B routers please And show ip route output of relevant prefixesAnd I thought you were trying to reach 19216816427 network not 100155233 RVCE 100155233 is a router sitting in front of 19216816427 so my reasoning was that if I cant reach that I wont go further show ip route gives thousands of pages worth of output There are about 650k entries in the BGP table  Somehow this has starting working though I think the problem was on the other end at all so the only problem here appears to be the metric issue you brought up earlier

are typically caused by sending IP packets using the cellular interface where the source address is not the address negotiated for the cellular interface So the first thing that I looked for was whether you were doing address translation for traffic going out the cellular interface I found that you are using a route map which combines a match on the interface and a match on an ACL That is good and usually works So I looked for something that might send data out the cellular which would not match the ACL I find that your IP SLA sends traffic specifying an IP address which is not in the network specified in the ACL ip sla 1 icmpecho 9668xxxxx sourceip 9668xxxxx next hop I suspect this is the cause of your problem You either need to find a way to force IP SLA to only send traffic out the Ethernet interface or you need to expand the ACL to include this source address HTH Rick RVCE Thank you for the response So I changed the the ip sla to this ip sla 1 icmpecho 966837xxx sourceinterface GigabitEthernet00 frequency 10ip sla schedule 1 life forever starttime now but Im still getting flapping from the cellular interface I have a static ip address from comcast and that address is the next hop Below is what I get when I disconnect g00 Apr 4 013824878 LINEPROTO5UPDOWN Line protocol on Interface GigabitEth ernet00 changed state to downApr 4 013825878 LINK3UPDOWN

dont have to TAG your redistriubte route you can do but its not a requirment as for advertising the eigrp route just specify what route you wish to redistribute in your routemap stanza res Paul Please dont forget to rate any posts that have been helpfulThanks RVCE Hello paul driver Yes I am thinking that you are right No need it but I made correct to Julio Moisa configuration Regards Deepak Kumar RVCE The discussion about controlling redistribution from EIGRP to BGP using a route map is correct and correct that using tags is an optional alternative If I am understanding the original post correctly there are multiple static routes that are redistributed into EIGRP And from EIGRP only certain routes will be redistributed into BGP I believe the original poster will find that this does not work The static routes will be in the EIGRP topology table and will be advertised to EIGRP peers But when redistributing from EIGRP into BGP it will redistribute only EIGRP entries And on the originating device these routes are in the routing table as static and not EIGRP and therefore will not be redistributed If the original poster wants specific static routes to be processed by BGP there needs to be either BGP network statements for the specific static routes or redistribution of static into BGP with controls on the redistribution to allow only the specific static HTH Rick RVCE

RVCE Thanks for the suggestion I followed the instructions but still devices connected to FE0FE3 not connected to InternetIs it because the router is connected to private network102xx addresses and its not possible to route asked in other forums N RVCE Hello you mean your computers have IP addresses in the 102xx range  Can you at least ping 8888 from the router  Anything can be routed but you need a layer 3 interface which is the default gateway for your clients The network also needs to be added to the access list that is used for NAT eg interface VLAN10 ip address 10211 2552552550 ip nat inside accesslist 1 permit 10210 000255 RVCE All devices connected to internet have 102xx address because its a private networkAnd im able to ping 8888 on the router and its successfulBut on the device connected to router through FE0 to FE3 not able to ping googlecom yes 10211 is the default gateway for the clients RVCE Hi Naveen1 Did the devices connected to interface fa0  fa3 receive IP addresses from the DHCP pool 1921681x2 If yes could you ping 19216811 from those devices How about 102113 If no please post the output of show vlanswitch brief If you made many changes please post sh run as wellHTHMeheretab RVCE 10211 is the gateway already used Can I use the same for this router bacause FE4 has IP address 102174 and when I configure interface Vlan1 ip address 10211 2552552550 I get IP address conflicts

Intermittent internet issue,Hi We have been experiencing random intermittent internet connection What I noticed though is whenever we are experiencing slow internet connection our access to our Internet Router is also not stable Ping from Internet router to outside address the latency is normal and no packet drops Ping from any PC to outside address very slow and lots of packet drops I also noticed that when the issue with internet connection occurs access to the Internet router is sluggish I did a continuous ping to outside address and the Internet router at the same time the packet loss seems to occur at the same time I checked switches routers and firewalls interfaces but did not find anything that has an high number of errors or output drops or even duplex mismatch Any suggestions Thanks in advance Solved Go to Solution,Hello if you feel comfortable enough to do this open the chassis and reseat the fan tray Also check if there is dust or dirt on the fan I dont really think that this is related to your intermittent failures but it could be indicative ofold hardware that is about to die How long is this router in service  RVCE Hello the first thing I would do is reboot the router an uptime of  1 year by itself is quite long See if you can get the fan issue resolved and connect a PC directly to the router When the other users experience problems check if the PC directly connected to the router has the same problem If not you know the router is not the problem RVCE Hi Based on details in the post it looks like internal issue How is your network setup basic diagramconfigs Issue related all users or specific subnet traffic Share some details Thx MS RVCE Hi If from the Internet router pings are normal and there is no packet loss than there is no issue with the provider or Internet connection The problem seems to be internal to your network Can you check firewalls and other devices on the patch for high CPU Also do you have ACL on the Internet router and the firewalls blocking unwanted traffic from the Internet HTH RVCE During that time the CPU utilization was normal for all of the devices No accesslist on the router for blocking traffic from the Internet We have traffic shaping in place which I suppose is not the cause of the issueOther thing I noticed was when I ping all other device on the network leading up to the Internet routerthere was no latency and packet drops But ping to Internet router was very slow Here is the basic logical diagramAccessLayerSWCoreSWFWBPZSWIntFWIntRTRPhysically the IntFW and IntRTR are both connected to BPZSW on the same VLAN RVCE Hello what platform is your router eg ISR4331  There are so many devices in front of your router that it is impossible to tell which one is the culprit I would connect a PC directly to the router and test the connection than connect the PC to the next downstream device and so on until you find the one that causes the delay RVCE Hi GeorgThanks for the response please see information belowCisco 2851 revision 5351 Cisco IOS Software 2800 Software C2800NMADVIPSERVICESK9M Version 12422T5ThanksRandy RVCE Hello the 2851s end of lifeend of sale date is somewhere around 2011 I am not saying that this IS the problem but with hardware that old this could be an issue What kind of Internet connection do you have what is the updown speed  RVCE Hi Georg We have a dedicated Internet with 24mbp speed which is burstible to 60mbps In addition weve been seeing this logs on the router not sure if this could be related ENVMON4FANLOWRPM Fan 1 service recommended Thanks RVCE Hello if you feel comfortable enough to do this open the chassis and reseat the fan tray Also check if there is dust or dirt on the fan I dont really think that this is related to your intermittent failures but it could be indicative ofold hardware that is about to die How long is this router in service  RVCE Hi GeorgThe office has been setup fairly recently The router has been up for over a year What else can you suggest I should checkThanks RVCE Hello the first thing I would do is reboot the router an uptime of  1 year by itself is quite long See if you can get the fan issue resolved and connect a PC directly to the router When the other users experience problems check if the PC directly connected to the router has the same problem If not you know the router is not the problem RVCE Hi GeorgI kind of did similar to this When issue is happening I logged to both BPZSW and IntFW devices I did ping from both devices to the IntRTR and they are experiencing packet dropsI try your suggestion next time it happensThanks for helping outMore power to you
Multihomed NAT Balancing Problem,Hello Ive trouble with NAT CE has two uplinks Two ISPs two 30 networks Id like to utilize both connections in the following manner As supposed  the first half of Internet  on the left the rest  on the right And also there is redundancy  if one of the links goes down its route is automatically moved on the remaining live link Addresses 0127xxx are routed to exit through Fa00101 and NATted to 19487670 addresses 128223xxx are routed to exit through Fa00102 and NATted to 19487674 Reverse traffis will come in the same interface as the traffic destined TO Internet passed through  because of SrcIP 19487670 19487674 becomes DstIP and packet routed by provider to the corresponging interface Fa00101Fa00102 The problem is when both links are alive the SrcIP on the second Fa00102 is NATted to 19487670 instead of expected 19487674This leads to the following traffic distribution traffic destined to 00001 goes inout through Fa00101 traffic destined to 1280001 goes out through Fa00102 but returns back through the Fa00101 As I invesigated in both cases NAT translates SrcIP according to the first rule i e this oneBecause conditions are true  SrcIP192168xx falls under both accesslists 101 and 102 So it picks THE FIRST AVAILABLE RULE for translation Is there way to make NAT to translate exactly to the address OF OUTGOING interface no to the addres OF THE RULE Can I bind interface to accesslist rule or tracking object to the NAT rule Another ways Kind regardsEllad Solved Go to Solution,Check that link

Cisco 2811 512MB CF card readable by IOS but not by rommon,HelloI have two MSDOS FAT 16 512MB Compact Flash cards Cisco brand and I cant seem to get my either of my two 2811 routers to read these cards in rommon I can read them on my PC and I have confirmed FAT 16 formatting When I boot the router rommon reports open Open Error  66boot cannot open flashboot cannot determine first executible file name on device flash If I load an image from tftp using tftpdnld r it loads a 151 image successfully into memory and I have subsequently formatted the CF card format flash  from IOS successfully show flash works fine I have even copied another image over to the 512MB flash via my IOS session using tftp IOS doesnt have any issues with the CF card I can do a show flash all and it reports multiple partitions However when reload the router the boot stage dumps execution control into rommon indicating that it cant read the CF card  error 66 again I have looked at Ciscos Using Compfact Flash Memory cards whitepaper and read some other posts where the poster indicated the CF card lost its partitions However in my case i have reformatted using format flash which should create a class C filesystem I have also seen various posts that indicate the 2811 can support up to 2GB flash sizes so this 512MB card should be fine Any ideas this seems more complicated that it should beThanks in advanceWill Solved Go to Solution,well thats a good question they were purchased off eBay as authentic CF cardsThe reason why I ask this obvious question is because some else posted a similar issue with their socalled Cisco branded CF that was recently purchased from eBay The thread was about two weeks old Well the CF didnt work because they werent really Cisco CF So when he got another nonCisco branded CF they worked I am suspecting you got your CF from the same sellerMy recommendation is go to your favorite electronics shop and get two different brand of 2Gb or up to 4 Gb CF and try both of them out RVCE In rommon have you initialized the flash before trying to read it RVCE thanks for the reply how would I initialize the flash beforehand within rommon I looked through the published rommon command set but didnt see anything relevant other than reset commandthat said I tried set without success it just reportsUpgrade ROMMON initializedprogram load complete entry point 0x8000f000

read one posting where someone had a similar issue so he upgraded rommon but it didnt make a difference he eventually indicated his particular issue was tied to the fact that the partitions on the CF card were corrupt so not sure if its worth trying to ugprade the rommon not sure how to check the version while within rommon either i tried cookie but its a rather cryptic output RVCE In rommon of you type dir flash do you get the 66 error RVCE I do So check this out  I booted this router 2811 using a TFTP image using tftpdnld r to avoid rommon from attempting to write to flash after pulling the image over the network Once the IOS image was decompressed and loaded into memory I did the following successfull command displaying the flash in detailR10show flash all length datetime path1

fat16 and fat32 as 2800 series CF documenation indicates it supports both but resutls are the samei can create a smaller partition using fat16 using windows diskpart utility i may try 256MB because i pulled a 256MB lexar CF out of this very router and it was fine RVCE I have subsequently partitioned the 512MB CF card into a 256MB partition without success I went a step further and partitioned down to 128MB without any luck I put a 64MB CF card in and it works just fine I was really hoping to use these 512MB Cisco CF cards I did end up going into privilged rommon mode and an initfs didnt do much A flash erase failed with error code 72 A flash info reports its full size of 512MB RVCE Are you sure this is a Cisco branded CF RVCE well thats a good question they were purchased off eBay as authentic CF cards I have used nonCisco cards with success in the past however  ie 256MB Lexar card But given that IOS can read these cards if I boot from a tftp IOS image wouldnt that help speak to the integrity of the CF card and its formatting RVCE well thats a good question they were purchased off eBay as authentic CF cardsThe reason why I ask this obvious question is because some else posted

need NAT assistance on ASA 5510 behind another NAT firewall,Greetings The topology is a MPLS network NAT is done on the edge networkbased firewall before the traffic goes to the Internet Each remote site on the MPLS has its own router The site in question also has an ASA 5510 that sits behind the router mainly to allow VPN connections We just acquired this network and found a few issues I believe the main issue is the ASA 5510 is also trying to do some sort of NAT as well I constantly see errors in the logs like thisI cant ping the inside interface of the ASA unless Im on the same subnet Also the realtime log doesnt appear to be showing my ICMP attempts The location does have a few static NAT devices facing the public but those translations are done on the edge NBFW Here is the current NAT config nat insideOutside source static any any noproxyarp routelookup I think that I need to disable NAT on the 5510 but Im unsure of exactly what needs done Any help would be greatedly appreciated Thanks,
Route Statement for 192168 ,Is it best practice to write statements for all your internal 192168X subnets or just put one 19216800 25525500 statement eg 19216800 25525500 1010101,If you have only one exit point gateway it is best practice to summarize the routes or simply advertise default route HTH Meheretab RVCE No there would be at least 2x gateways to send 192168 traffic depending on the subnetSo lets say I just had 1 gateway and I needed routes for 1921681X  192168254X it is best to create the statement like this19216800 25525500 1010101
NXOS route leaking from VRF to Global routing table,I would like to leak routes from the VRF called production into the global routing table and leak routes from the global routing table to the vrf on NXOS I was able to accomplish the route leaking but I cant ping from the NXOS device itself to the leaked routes or from an upstream router This is a VIRL lab and the setup is pretty easyI have an IOSV router running EIGRP and its interface is 1921681224The NXOS switch is running EIGRP on 1921681124 and BGP for the route leakingThe config for this is applied on the NXOS and here are the detailsThe production routes make it to the IOSV router no problem via the redistribution but I cant communicate to them Is there something Im missingThank you vrf context ProductionVRF addressfamily ipv4 unicast routetarget both 991 import vrf default map any export vrf default map any  router eigrp SiteA autonomoussystem 14 addressfamily ipv4 unicast routerid 1032551 passiveinterface default metric version 64bit redistribute bgp 99 routemap any  router bgp 99 addressfamily ipv4 unicast network 10312023 network 1921681024 vrf ProductionVRF addressfamily ipv4 unicast network 1019024 Show commands on the NXOS to show the leaked routes STASpine201 sh ip route bgpIP Route Table for VRF default denotes best ucast nexthop denotes best mcast nexthopxy denotes preferencemetricstring in via output denotes VRF string1019024 ubestmbest 10 attached via 10192ProductionVRF Vlan9 200 001038 bgp99 external tag 99   STASpine201 show ip route vrf productionVRF bgpIP Route Table for VRF ProductionVRF denotes best ucast nexthop denotes best mcast nexthopxy denotes preferencemetricstring in via output denotes VRF string10312023 ubestmbest 10 attached via 103122default Vlan1012 200 001518 bgp99 external tag 99 1921681024 ubestmbest 10 attached via 19216811default Eth21 200 000743 bgp99 external tag 99,Hi Can you share your virl file ThanksFrancescoPS Please dont forget to rate and select as validated answer if this answered your question RVCE I used dcloud virl lab and I do not have it sorry and thank you for replying RVCE Hello I have recreated your setup in GNS3 using the VIRL images it appears to work as designed I can ping the leaked routes locally Can you post the config of the upstream device the one that cannot ping the leaked routes externally as well  RVCE Thank you for your efforts The upstream router has a very simple config I do not have the power to recreate this in my lab so I use dcloud for my testing NXOSV int g00no shutip address 19216812 2552552550router eigrp 14no autosummarynetwork 19216812 0000
Change to suppressmap for BGP aggregate does not take effect,I have a simple topology in LAB to test thisR1  R2  R3 R1 is configured with few 32 loopbacksLoopback1 11111111Loopback2 11111211Loopback3

match ip address prefixlist Send1213tooroutemap SuppressMap permit 20 Now I know summaryonly doesnt make sense or is pointless in conjunction with suppressmap but thats how it was configured on real device so I wanted to test similar scenario Anyway it works this way R2 sends aggregate route along with more specific route for 1111121132 Problem is when I make the change to prefixlist  I want additional 32 route to be advertisedunsuppressed So I add entry to prefixlistip prefixlist Send1213too permit 1111131132 And it has no effect Local BGP table on R2 still shows 1111131132 to be

25525500 summaryonly suppressmap SuppressMap QeustionWhile this got me to desired state Im wondering if theres a more clever elegant solution Does Cisco IOS have any command specific for this case Something to reevaluate routemap for aggregate,Hi Michal Try to remove the summaryonly option and test one question i have is where do you have the following prefix list applied ip prefixlist Block1213 permit 1111131132 all I see is your suppressed prefix applied to the suppressmap I guess not seeing all the configuration is not helping but please look at the following blog compare it to your configuration and see what you missing httppacketlifenetblog2008sep20bgprouteaggregationpart2 RVCE The prefixlist Block1213 is matched in routemap  if you look closer I gave the configuration of routemap where you can find it ip prefixlist Block1213 permit 1111131132is simply an update to already existing prefixlist I tried without summaryonly but no change RVCE Hello not sure if this is a BGP specific bug but at least in GNS3 using 156 if you use a standard access list instead of the prefix list updates work So instead of ip prefixlist Send1213too seq 5 permit 1111121132ip prefixlist

Multiple OSPF Processes  RouterID Election from Loopbacks,Having difficulty in finding a firm answer on this detailed scenario so here goesScenario One1 router with two2 OSPF processes running on it and two2 loopback interfaces  IP addresses have been definedThe root question Which OSPF process will get which RouterIDIP address from which interfaceIn conjunction with the question above there are two possibilities but there is also an important implied question of consistencyIn other words will OSPF processX ALWAYS get the same RouterID and OSPF processY ALWAYS gets its same RouterID both based on looking to available and not already in use loopback interfaces  So essentially what is Ciscos mechanism  is it consistent across IOS versions There seems to again be two philosophies  Either Cisco says the process with the lower or higher process number goes first which would provide consistent results or it says whichever one comes first in the config goes first which will most likely always remain the same but at least in theory could be altered  thus effect the resulting RouterID assignedTo IllustrateMock Things Upinterface Loopback0 ip address 1111 255255255255interface Loopback1 ip address 2222 255255255255router ospf 100 network x x area xrouter ospf 200 network y y area yHere ospf 100 should have RouterID 1111 and ospf 200 RouterID 2222 but is that because it came first or because it has the lower process number Would the results be the same if the IOS version changed or the config looked like this from topdowninterface Loopback0 ip address 1111interface Loopback1 ip address 2222router ospf 200 network y y area yrouter ospf 100 network x x area xie What do you think ospf 200s RouterID isPlease Note to nip some things in the bud The typical selection process for determining the RouterID is known you dont need to post it just for the sake of posting it Also Yes  Im aware that by explicitly specifying the RouterID in each process resolves the consistency matter but then there would have been no needpoint in asking the questions and the questions are more about the mechanism and resulting consistency used by Cisco in a multiprocess environment than actually having a how do I get the end result answer Ive also done testing in lab so I can essentially answer the question but a few small tests dont necessarily make things definitive nor would it prompt discussionThanks,DanIt is good to see you active in the forumI have some experience with this but not enough to be definitive But enough to contribute to the discussion In my experience the first process to initialize will get the higher of the loopback interface addresses In general I would expect the process listed first in the config to be the one to initialize first And as far as I remember the IOS has been fairly consistent in listing the processes in numeric orderSo I would expect some consistency that the lower numbered process should generally get the higher loopback address as its RID But as you comment it is not something that we can really count on  who knows what would cause a process to take longer to initializeMy recommendation is that consistency is a very good thing and to assure real consistency you should configure the RID in each processHTHRick RVCE HelloFirst of all I am not posting for the sake of posting I get the picture that you have done your homework I am posting because I find this interesting and although I have never done this test myself I would really like to know the answer you already have I will try to put myself in the routers shoes or rather in the poor guys shoes that write the software for it When the administrator does not specify things by force I have to make a decision of my own When you start the first process I cannot generally know if you will start a second process later or when you do start one whether the second process will have a higher ospf process number than the first one only in the case where you chose process number 1 for the first process could I know that the second process will have a higher process number So I follow the same logic every time you start a process I only like upup interfaces I like loopbacks more than any other interface I try to grab the loopback with the highest id not already in use If you have 100 loopbacks I will begin my search from the highest and when I find the first available I stop my search If you have no loopbacks or are all already in use I will try using highest IP address from upup interfaces If administrator does not like what I do I give him a hook to routerid the process by forceKind RegardsM RVCE Maria You are right that it is an interesting question and we welcome you as part of the discussionOne small point both you and Dan seem to believe that the OSPF process will prefer to take the loopback with the lowest interface number In my experience OSPF prefers to take the address that is numerically higher So it matters less whether it is loopback0 or loopback1 and matters more whether it is network 1111 or 2222 If Dan has test results that indicate that the behavior has changed since I did my testing with this which has been a while please jump in Other than that I think that your summary of the router logic is right on the markedit when I reread your post I see that I misinterpreted your discussion about the search for the loopback My first read thought that you were saying that it stopped when it found the first available which I thought meant first numerically available interface Now that I read again you did specify that it starts from the highest and searches for an available address My apologies HTHRick RVCE Yes you are right I got a bit confused on this I have edited my response when I saw my own note about nonloopbacks but I am still confused The process for other types of interfaces is clear to me I think I got it right in the first place but the loopback part still confuses me I think I have read about first configured loopback somewhere else but I am not absolutely sure I will keep searching all night it is 2100 in Greece now unless we have the answer I want to add one thing however When router initializes it does not matter if configuration of OSPF processes is sorted This because the configuration is passed to the parser and from the parsers point of view this procedure is no different than the procedure the administrator follows to conf t during normal router operationKind RegardsMps Keep editing wrote interfaces instead of processes Id better go to sleep RVCE You were right in the first place you read correctly I am the one that keeps making mistakes spelling and nonspelling You are quick I should edit faster I got my library down on the carpet and the Cisco IP Routing superbook from Alex Zinin says that the command routerid  was introduced in IOS 121 Before that the routerid was selected automatically by using highest IP address logic first tried loopbacks and then other interfacesKind RegardsMps Still not gone to sleep but I can handle copying the book  RVCE Maria I am glad that I did not misread the post the first time around And I believe that you are correct in the revised way that you describe it The general logic is only consider addresses that are not already used as router ID only consider addresses that are upup prefer loopback interfaces and then physical interfaces prefer numerically higher addresses to numerically lower addressesSo IOS searches among available loopback interfaces for the numerically highest available loopback and if it finds no available loopback then it searches among available physical interfaces for the numerically highest available physical interface And if it can not find any available loopback or physical interface to serve as RID then the process does not initializeHTHRick RVCE Rick I am giving you 5 for helping me clear this point with highest IP address logic Have fun in NetProEdit Good summarization man I will give you another 5 so others and me can find this information right away when needed RVCE Maria Thank you for the compliment and for the ratingNow it is time for you to get some sleepHTHRick RVCE Hello Rick  AllNice to see youre active as ever hereYeah it was an interesting pondering as I looked into routerid behavior under multiple processes and thought it might make for some discussion andor debateFor any that are curious we have monitoring that gathers quite a bit of information for dissemination  alerting of problems and the potential of differing values can give it confusion so bringing consistency while allowing for things to be semidynamic use of loopbacks versus an explicit routerid led me down this roadBTW there were commentsthen edits in the posts above so Im not sure where things stood but Im not under the impression interface number matters it doesnt but rather its the highest IP on any available loopback that is not already a routerid However since reedits seem to be fashionable I do see in my first example I also flipped the routerid mistakenly kudos to you if you caught it  sorry if it brought confusion Let me repost the examples correctlyTo IllustrateMock Things Upinterface Loopback0 ip address 1111 255255255255interface Loopback1 ip address 2222 255255255255router ospf 100 network x x area xrouter ospf 200 network y y area yHere ospf 100 should have RouterID 2222 and ospf 200 RouterID 1111 but is that because it came first or because it has the lower process number Would the results be the same if the IOS version

you think ospf 200s RouterID isThe ResultsAs for actual behavior its somewhat disappointing It appears the order in the config determines which process goes first and not the process number upon reload  Nor does the CLI rearrange things for you That means in the 2nd example  ospf 200 gets 2222 So be mindful of how you order things as with ACLs to get the desired resultsAlso note a clearing of the ospf processes does not necessarily reset everything  And it is possible to retain what would be an existing wrong routerid if you went by normal election rules until the router is actually reloaded Think of a case where you delete a process with a higher loopback routerid  The remaining process will retain its original value until a reload unless it too is deleted and readded thereby triggering the election of a routeridRegards RVCE HelloI will repeat something I have already said because it might have been lost in the postings above When you start the first process router cannot generally know if you will start a second process later or when you do start the second process whether the second process will have a higher ospf process number than the first one only in the case where you chose process number 1 for the first process could router know that the second process will have a higher process number So the router follows the same logic every time you start a process Cannot wait for you to enter following process configuration to see what you mean Commands take effect as they are entered not in the futureNow when router initializes the configuration is passed to the parser and from the parsers point of view this procedure is no different than the procedure the administrator follows to conf t during normal router operation So it follows same procedure only in this case the ospf process ids are passed to the parser sorted lowest first The parser still does not care at initialization that configuration is sorted The configuration file contains all the commands you had entered but not in the order in which you entered them so some information is inevitably lost during initializationThis does not seem that disappointing to me especially if I have done nothing to make things work my way Whenever a process starts the same procedure is followed The process number is never used as a factor in the algorithm because it cant It requires knowledge from the future for something like this to work This future knowledge can only be taken advantage of at initialization but not during normal operation so even if something like this had been implemented it would still not be consistent with normal operationKind RegardsM RVCE Hehe  Fair enough on your point regarding consistent startup behavior in your last paragraph since from the routers perspective by taking whatever process comes listed first is being consistentSo perhaps I should rephrase There is consistency in the manner in which the router initializes the config so I cant be disappointed there its disappointing least in my case that the parser doesnt look at all entries at the time of initialization and then orders by process number I completely understand of course not taking into account additional processes that get added afterwards  Im only referring to startupIn other words youre saying the router parses the ospf processes topdown first come first serve where as what I was hoping for would more like route selection per se where the more specific route is selected even if its not listed first but of course in this case it would be that the process number acted more like a priority in determining which goes firstOutside of that  I appreciate you input  comments Thanks RVCE The parser is a simple stupid program that reads commands one line at a time Having stupid programs in embedded systems is good Simple and neat fewer bugs Bugs are still out there of course but could be more  RVCE This is a fascinating discussion and I cannot resist the temptation to throw a spanner in the works I just want to take a sideways look at this question for a momentAs I understand it the RID intrinsically has nothing to do with any IP address It is just a 32bit number that identifies the router It does not need to be a routeable IP address But for its purpose it is pretty essential to ensure that it is unique within the OSPF domain So the algorithm the router uses for want of any hardcoded value a number equal to one of its IP addresses in the hope that it will be uniqueHaving said that what happens when you have two OSPF processes Why have the software writers chosen to ensure that the RID is different between the processes What would happen if they are the sameAs far as I am aware you cannot run the two OSPF processes on the same real interface  they would get their Hellos confused So why do you need the RIDs to be differentKevin DorrellLuxembourg RVCE KevinWelcome to the discussion I believe that Dan as the original poster would agree that the more participants the better I have some comments about a couple of your pointsI believe that you are correct that the RID is a 32 bit number that identifies the router As part of the process of accurately drawing the topology map you want to uniquely identify each data source As an identifier the RID does not need to be a routable address but should be unique within the OSPF domainLeft to its own the OSPF process will pick an IP address from one of the interfaces on the router This should assure that the RID will be unique because we assume that an IP address should appear at only 1 place in the network If the same address does appear in more than one place then your network has problems You do not need to let the OSPF process pick the interface and you have the option to manually configure the RID As Dan points out there are possibilities that over time the OSPF process might pick different addresses for its RID So if you have some reason to want to have very stable choice of RID as Dan does then manual configuration is recommended If you manually configure the RID there is no requirement that the RID be matched in a network statement and no requirement that the RID be an address that is advertised to neighbors In fact it is not a requirement that the RID actually be an address on that router if manually configured You are certainly correct that you can not run 2 OSPF

WRP500 is dropping outbound SSH sessions after a short timeout is this a NAT network address translation expiry issue,I deployed a Cisco WRP500 a SOHOsized wifi router with two builtin analog telephone adapter lines recently As a replacement for the nowdiscontinued WRP400 it works well except for one issue I am finding that SSH sessions from individual computers behind the WRP500s NAT to outside Internet servers are being silently dropped after even a few minutes of inactivity On an outbound SSH connection to a commercial data centre so no NAT on their end just ours the connection might still be alive after ten minutes of activity but will be dead after 1520 minutes I looked at httpssupportforumsciscocomt5networkinfrastructuredocumentshowtoconfigureanattranslationtimeouttap3109488 and httpssupportforumsciscocomt5wanroutingandswitchingsshsessionsovernatwilltimeoutanddisconnectwhytdp1068624 but neither appear to apply to the WRP500 all theyre telling me is that some other Cisco device at the higher end of the market has a configurable NAT translation timeout which defaults to something sensible ie one day I checked the WRP500 pdf administration manual and the 192168151 administration interface there are NAT options to forward specific ports but I find no indication of how quickly an open but inactive connection such as an SSH session sitting idle at the command line should expire and no indication of how to set this timeout to something sensible If I leave an application open such as top which prints a list of active processes at 3second intervals the connection remains alive If I leave the connection open but idle it dies in a few minutes  in the stock Linux SSH server and client the client goes unresponsive then later shuts down with a broken pipe error This started happening when we upgraded to the WRP500 the older WRP400 for all of its other quirks and bugs was fine in this regard Is there any way to get the WRP500 to stop disconnecting idle SSH connections in which it is the intermediate NAT node,

2960 High Memory Processor,Hi guys  Hope someone can point me in the right directionWe have 08 Cisco Switch model WSC2960G24TCL running a 1502SE8  MD  25MAY2015 firmware version All of them are working with more than 80 memory processor I didnt find any memory leak bug in this specific firmware version although Cisco recommends an upgrade for a more recent version Version 1522E7  MD   14JUL2017 My questions are 01  Is there a risk to run with that amount of process memory in used  The switch behavior is normal so far02  Is that total amount of process memory too low  Because I realized that some others switch models has much more process memory than this 03  Am I able to do a Switch DRAM memory upgrade  Thank you in advance   Pedro Alexandre,
Dual ISP router configuration  New ISP,Hey guys I work for a very small ISP and we are about to change our wholesale provider Our current provider supplies us with a 22 of public IPs and since we are changing providers we will now have a new 22 being routed to us What I want to accomplish is having both our old ISP and the new one connected to our main router so I can slowly change our DHCP pools and static IPs throughout our network to the new block with little to no downtime for our customers I am not very experienced in this and have never done it before so I am looking for some advicebest practice to doing this Would it be as simple as adding another static route to the new providers router Ex ip route 1234 2552552520 78910Where 1234 22 is the new 22 block and 78910 is the new ISPs router ThanksAdam,
Failover between two routers with different connections on same subnet,We are getting a Meraki MX250 for a lease line being put in and we currently already have a Draytek 3220 load balancing four BT connections Both would be plugged into one switch that is connected by fibre to a second switch each serving half of the business I am trying to figure out the best way to set up a network so our 70ish Windows 7 and 10 user PCs can be split among the two routers with failover both ways Further load balancing is not necessary but would be a bonus Ideally I would like it so if one router fails or is taken offline the other will take over all the trafficThe best approach I have so far is to turn off DHCP on the Draytek and set the PCs up with static IPs about 5050 on the DraytekMeraki Then set up 2 default gateways on each PC with metrics weighted heavily towards one router Im thinking this will switch the PCs default gateway to the other router in the event that one fails completely Other devices can just be left on one connection as they are less essential and dont require the same level of redundancyIve seen some people saying this wont work but Im not sure if they are talking about setups with local servers etc that require consistent access from a particular public IP As the PCs are already being load balanced between 4 BT connections I dont think switching ISP would be a problem Im just wondering if there is a simpler solution on the networking level  Ive read about BGP but Im not sure our connections would all be compatible and to be honest it sounds a bit above my level of technical proficiency currentlyPerhaps this can be managed at the switch level The switches are ZyXEL GS19001920s,
Cisco 887VA FTTCVDSL configuration,Hi folks I am currently working on obtaining my Routing and Switching qualification and thought I would replace my existing router with a Cisco 887VA All was going well when the expected IP address was showing on the dialer interface and able to ping IP and URL Then no web All LAN ports are in the default VLAN and my laptop is connectd to Fa0 via a straight Ethernet cable My laptop obtains the correct IP and default gateway but the LAN card shows Unidentified which means no traffic I specified an IP address and ran windows NETSH resetsreinstalled my NIC for the issue t remain As I have no issues with other routersswitches I am thinking it is my Cisco 887 Anyone able to see if I have missed something in my running config or kindly provide a little advice as using these dialer interfaces has thrown me a little Routershow runBuilding configurationCurrent configuration  1981 bytes No configuration change since last restartversion 151no service

be configured under the ip dhcp pool LANPOOL using dnsserver command not Google DNS But what you are experiencing is almost certainly the MTU issue My view is that you should configure ip mtu 1492 not mtu 1492 under the Dialer0 interface Also will you please try to add the ip tcp adjustmss 1452 under the same interface Will you please let me know if there is any progress Thanks  Regards Antonin RVCE Hi These are my observations 1 The default router under ip dhcp pool LANPOOL should be configured as defaultrouter 1921681150 ie your int Vlan1 address 2 The ip nat outside should be configured under interface Dialer0 I do not understand why you would need Dialer1 at all 3 The ip nat inside source  should be configured only as follows ip nat inside source list 1 interface Dialer0 overload 4 The default route should be configured as ip route 0000 0000 Dialer0 Will you please try to modify and let me know the result Thanks  Regards Antonin RVCE Thanks Antonin I really appreciate the help as the router is online with my laptop no longer showing unidentified and can ping IP address I specified Google DNS on my NIC and now able to get web pages all be it a little limited as Google searches return results but clicking a URL gives a spinning timer I changed my MTU to 1500 from 1492 as this is the default on my ISP provided router but getting the same issue Next step is to setup the router to provide DNS servers and troubleshoot if that doesnt work To answer your questions I was following different guides online where Dialer1 was used a lot I assume Dialer0 contained their ADSL config which was left in place and shutdown with ATM0 I had not changed my default route back for this reason and got a little twisted for my NAT A little further work is needed but progress

ip tcp adjustmss 1452 within the dialer0 interface and got web pages straight away This is something I have not done in Packet Tracer before maybe yet when configuring switches and routers I have covered the theory and understand the packet changes routing through different interfaces but thought the router would have handled this automatically A little reading on my end before quizzing the lecturer  Georg Pauwen you solved my DNS issue nicely I was going to use my ISP DNS but wasnt sure how to set the router to obtain dynamically So I thought I would set Google DNS but did it in the wrong place This is what i need at the moment and will come back to your other highlighted changes when I connect my test lab The next step is connect my wireless AP and other devices to ensure all is working Then sort out the SSH connection refused error and setup port forwarding for my Virtual Machine After this connect my Cisco test lab 2 x 2801 and 2 x 2960 TTL 1 x 1801 and a L3 switch when I

first to admit that I am still learning my way around Cisco Routersexpecially when it comes to config filesdo you have a suggestion as to where I should proceed from here I am curious about these two lines should they both be in there ip nat inside source list 1 interface GigabitEthernet01 overloadip route 0000 0000 GigabitEthernet01 dhcp this is the dfault route then RVCE Hello glad that you got the speed up Basically anything like access llists IDS etc you configure the router with that goes on top of basic connectivity slows it down since it has to be processed ip nat inside source list 1 interface GigabitEthernet01 overload  this just means that everything defined in access list 1 gets translated to the IP address of interface GigabitEthernet01ip route 0000 0000 GigabitEthernet01 dhcp  this sends all traffic to the SurfBoard The dhcp keyword is basically the same as putting an IP address as the next hop in the static route statement but since you dont know the address dhcp is used Defining an IP address as the next hop is usually faster than defining an interface since in the latter case the router has to ARP for the next hop RVCE okI did some reading and I understand that thanks for the explaination Now I tried to add just a little of my access list and it broke everything I added just the following  accesslist 1 remark INSIDEIFGigabitEthernet00accesslist 1 permit

why this would break it It need the SPECTRUM DHCP well so it allows port 6768 to do the dhcp RVCE Hello basically an access list has an implicit deny so anything you do not explicitly allow will be blocked Where is the Spectrum located that is what is the IP address  You can also use the Cisco as DHCP server by adding the below ip dhcp excludedaddress 19216801  ip dhcp pool LAN network 19216800

break everythingThe config I had sent here was working fine when I had the 20mps1mps servicethen when I upgraded to the 100mbps10mbps everything went nutsthankfully you pointed me in the right directionwith the basic config file I got the speeds back But when I add the just this part it all dies The Spectrum part allows them to do dhcp ports 6768 but if I add it no good The

Monitor total throughout  ISR4K,Hi is there a way to monitor the actual platform hardware throughput level on an ISR4K Cheers Jp,show platform hardware throughput level RVCE Hi Hector that just shows the total that can be used Not the actual amount being used RVCE The command that is closest to real time throughput utilization for the ISR 4400 family is show platform hardware qfp active datapath utilization RVCE Thanks is there an OID for this so I can graph it over time RVCE When comparing with the throughput license do you only count either input or output I imagine 100Mbps through the qfp is what is licensed Thanks And yes an OID would be nice
Nexus Sup1 upgrade from 628 to 6216,Hi guysthe plan is to upgrade nexus sup1 from 628 to 6216i have run the install command as per below and it looks i can do direct upgradeThe result is good there is no incompatibility issue However when i check the upgrade guide for direct upgrade to 6216 the minimum version is 628aCisco Nexus 7000 Series NXOS Software Upgrade and Downgrade Guide Release 6x  Cisco Current ReleaseReleases That Support Direct ISSU to the Current ReleaseISSDNXOS Release 6218628a 628b 6210 6212 6214 6216No SupportNXOS Release 6216628a 628b 6210 6212 6214No Support Questions1 can i perform direct upgrade from 628 to 6216 using ISSU or i need to upgrade to supported version first ie 628a 2 If i use manual upgrade can i directly upgrade to 8216 version normally how long is the down time thanks guys,Hi Yes you can go directly to 6216 2 If i use manual upgrade can i directly upgrade to 8216 version normally how long is the down time I would plan on upgrading the switch manually The boot time should not exceed 15 minutes so you just need a short window HTH
Cisco QoS  how to use traffic shaping for interface and bandwidthpriority for classes,I have VPLS MPLS which looks like a layer 2 switch to me carrier networks and Im currently developing QoS policies for them I have some sites with a 1000 physical link and CIRs like 50 mb 100 mb etc I need to do traffic shaping on these with a service policy otherwise I get drops and less performance with many traffic types The challenge is that as Im implementing various traffic classes in my QoS policy I it seems I can no longer traffic shape the entire physical interface to 50 mbps for example Instead I have to shape per traffic class which is really not what I want to do I would like to be able to shape the entire interface to 50 mbps then alot traffic types 30 20 of that etc and allow them to use more if it is available I am also using the priority queue for VoIP and I know it cant use extra available bandwidth since it is the priority queue Is there a way to do this while also shaping the entire interface I appreciate any tips,Hi Which router are you using and IOS version What config did you apply when saying you cant do shaping on interface Can you share your config I mean we always do HQOS with 1 policymap shaping the physical interface and then calling a 2nd policymap on which you define every classes When youre saying you cant shape the interface do you have any error message or how you determine shaping isnt working ThanksFrancescoPS Please dont forget to rate and select as validated answer if this answered your question RVCE Francesco Thank for the reply I guess I just wasnt familier with this type of nested QoS Im using mostly ISR 4Ks with IOS XE 031606 and ASRs with IOS XE 031603 So is the preferred best practice method is to do something like this interface GigabitEthernet000 servicepolicy output 50mbpsShape   policymap 50mbpsShape class classdefault shape average 50000000 servicepolicy QOS policymap QOS class VOIP priority percent 10 set cos 5 class CLASS2 bandwidth percent 40 set cos 4 etc RVCE Yes this is best practices because I mean you want to shape globally but want to define different type of bandwidth per class right But using just the shape in class default should work also ThanksFrancescoPS Please dont forget to rate and select as validated answer if this answered your question RVCE Your on the right track as also confirmed by FrancescoA couple of things to be aware of WAN providers count bandwidth at L2 but Its my belief that many Cisco shapers only count bandwidth at L3 If you find this true on your device you may want to shape at about 15 slower or whatever you think best represents your average L2 overheadYou might ask whether your provider is willing to tell you what they use for Bc andor Tc If they do you can configure your shaper to more accurately conform with how they enforce your CIRYour policy is setting CoS which is unusual unless you have a tagged VLAN handoffBTW for I am also using the priority queue for VoIP and I know it cant use extra available bandwidth since it is the priority queue thats not always true on Cisco devices On many the implicit policer only engages if PQ packets are queued
Two remote site at a different locations havong a same subnet,Hi I still confused on how to implement this Currently we have to remote site having a same subnet 1921681x24 Both sites using the same subnet and we need to connect to this site Both site will terminated at our CE router in their country From my site our CE to their CE routed via BGP using same ISP SITE A  1921681024SITE B  1921681024 we need to connect to both sites from our HQ office here Can this be done,Good morning You cant advertise two identical subnets onto the same common network youll cause yourself a world of pain There are two options ReIP one of the sites to remove the conflict or You could look to NAT one of the subnets to an alternative IP address range Cisco have written a handy document that will help you if you look to attack this issues with option 2 The link is below httpswwwciscocomcenussupportdocsipnetworkaddresstranslationnat137743html Thanks Simon RVCE Hi Simon Thanks for the very helpfull information Our customer is on production for more than ten years and now they have to connect to our office in Kuala Lumpur Ive been thinking about onetoone NAT and also parent  child VRF which I think is quite complicated Since the connection to our office is via mpls VRF might be the best way to solved this Regards Hakim Kipli RVCE You need to tie the sites together using L2 NB there are some technologies which allow L2 across L3 RVCE Hi Jason Thanks for the information Technically how this can be done based on your suggestion Your idea would help me a lot in this implementation Thanks HAKIM KIPLI RVCE Hi JasonWere you directing this question to meIf so technologies like L2TPv3

Locally originated route with an higher AD will be prefered over the BGP learnt route,Hi AllPlease refer the diagram I have a requirement to add a static route on a hub router pointing to the secondary network and advertise it into MPLS cloud 1000024 is the LAN subnet which is already learnt via MPLS at hub location If I add a static route at hub pointing the 4G network with an AD of 100 and advertise them using network statement into MPLS cloud by adding ASPATH does hub router will remove the 1000024 subnet learnt from MPLS because there is a locally originated route which is getting advertised into BGP  If yes what is the solution for this problem Solved Go to Solution,Hello set the weight on the MPLS neighbor to 65535 the highest value The weight of the locally originated route is 32768 by default so the higher weight is preferred RVCE Hello set the weight on the MPLS neighbor to 65535 the highest value The weight of the locally originated route is 32768 by default so the higher weight is preferred RVCE Thank you Georg Pauwen I think that is the solution for my problem However Is there any other option to make MPLS routes preferred over the locally originated static routes just by tweaking the new static route related configurations without touching the existing MPLS neighbor attributes

BGP Fundamentals Help,Hi guys I am currently studying up on BGP and have a few queries of three scenarios which I cannot understand Can you help with below Scenario 1 There are two networks Network 1 within the 1921681024 subnet and Network 2 within the 1921682024 subnet Both have a single connection to SP1 which runs BGP within AS 1000Network 1s CE Router has a default route to the SP1 PE Router as does Network 2 which are redistributed to their respective IGPsIf Network 1 wants to talk to IP addresses within Network 2 how does this happen Scenario 2 There are two networks Network 1 and Network 2 are both within the 1921681024 subnet Both have a single connection to SP1 which runs BGP within AS 1000Network 1s CE Router has a default route to the SP1 PE Router as does Network 2 which are redistributed to their respective IGPsIf Network 1 wants to talk to IP addresses within Network 2 how does this happen when they are within the same subnet Scenario 3 There are two networks Network 1 within the 1921681024 subnet and Network 2 within the 1921682024 subnet Both have two connctions to SP1 which runs BGP within AS 1000Network 1 and Network 2 just so happen to share the same AS number 65530 and taks to SP1 via BGPIf Network 1 wants to talk to IP addresses within Network 2 how does this happen when the AS numebrs are the same Thanks in advance ,Hi Apologies if I understanding incorrectly but Networks 1 and 2 are on the same customer side configured on the CE router or are they different routers could you please share the topologies If you are have an eBGP with the ISP basically the ISP must provide the AS number to be used on the client side Thank you in advance  RVCE Thank you for the reply Imagine they are two completely different sites connected to two completely different PE routers RVCE Thank you for the clarification Now if you have 2 switches connected to the same ISP through BGP probably the ISP is using MPLS to move the traffic from the site A to site B now it should be transparent for you now the ISP will be involved on the routing procedures Site A and the site B will be advertising their networks through BGP to their BGP peers in this case to the ISP take in consideration if both sites A and B have the same AS number for example 1000 the ISP must be informed to apply ASOverride in order to enable the flow of the networks otherwise the site A and B will not be able to reach the networks from each other because the iBGP rule Split Horizon rule

2960C performance,Hello all one of our customers uses the 2960c at a lot of locations but at one location we see some strange behavior when it comes to performanceThe location has this setup 887VA DSL router for EVPN connectivity2 2960C switches1800 access points303 VDSL EVPN connection30040 Docsis Internet connection The DSL is for corporate use the other connection is for clients this is a healthcare customerThe location has an Internet connection with a Docsis modem The connection is  30040 Mbps For a part of the network the Docsis modem is also DHCPserver and router The Docsis modem is directly connected to Gi02 on the 2960C This port is configured as an access port If we test the internet connection connected to one of the fast ethernet interfaces on the 2960C the download speed tops at 4041 Mbps It does not matter if one client of several clients are using this switch The upload speed during tests is conform what the ISP allows If I move the link to the Docsis modem to a fast ethernet interface the results are even more dramatic because then the download speed drops to 10 Mbps If I change the vlan to break out via the EVPN the download speed goes to 30 Mbps One should be able to expect near 100 Mbps performance so in summarylaptop  fast ethernetdocsis modem  gigabitdownload max 40 Mbps laptop  fast ethernetdocsis modem  fast ethernetdownload max 10 Mbps laptop  fast ethernetinternet via EVPN 881 is connected to a gig interfacedownload max 30 Mbps A client directly connected to the Docsis modem gets the full monty when it comes to performance To rule out any interop issues I placed a 891 router between the Docsis modem and the 2960c knowing that it will not give us max speed and the results stayed the same Directly connected to the 891 gave me 120 Mbps down routed but also when using the switch only The portconfig for the tested ports are switchport mode accessswitchport access vlan 34spanningtree portfast The switces were originally running a late 12255 version I upgraded them to 1526E and downgraded one of the two switches there are 2 at this location to 1522E7 This made no difference There are two other locations with a similar setup One site shows the same behavior the other does not a speedtest on an iPhone gave 80Mbps down The main difference is the two slow site use a Connect Box docsis modem and the other uses an older Cisco Docsis modem My first thought was interop issue but the test with the 891 router ruled that out CPU and memory use were always low during the tests I am a bit lost where to look for a solution The customer already tested with a few el cheapo switches and the performance was good on those so that also bugs us Any ideas  With kind regards Marcel Tempelman Solved Go to Solution,Switch to DOCSIS is gig Client to switch is FE If so 2960 and 35603750 switches often have insufficient buffers for the speed slow down especially if QoS is enabled and running with defaults Any drops show on switch portsHave you tried DOCSIS and client at gigAm I reading correctly you did try DOCSIS and client at FE If so that too was slow For that perhaps the DOCSIS cannot sufficient queue packets You might clientDOCSIS at both FE and gig and see how they compare RVCE Switch to DOCSIS is gig Client to switch is FE If so 2960 and 35603750 switches often have insufficient buffers for the speed slow down especially if QoS is enabled and running with defaults Any drops show on switch portsHave you tried DOCSIS and client at gigAm I reading correctly you did try DOCSIS and client at FE If so that too was slow For that perhaps the DOCSIS cannot sufficient queue packets You might clientDOCSIS at both FE and gig and see how they compare RVCE Hello Joseph the DOCSIS modem is connected to the gig port om the 2960c and QoS is enabled I see drops on the fast ethernet ports I havens tried the client on the other gig port A colleague of mine tested with a 2960c and a ASA5505 in front of the DOCSIS and he was able to reach 7080 Mbps conform max perf of the 5505 He has a Ubee DOCSIS modem which is a different one A test with a Cisco DOCSIS modem on another location gave also better results Your analysis seems the right one to me I overestimated the switch performance probably so we might want to go for the CX of another Gig model RVCE Just did a test with a Ubee DOCSIS modem and a 2960c and a simple speedtest gave me 9095 Mbps with and without QoS enabled GigGig gave me 116 Mbps connection is limited to 150 Mbps FaFa set the limit around 65 Mbps So it seems the DOCSIS plays a crucial role in this RVCE Iperf3 test between 2 laptops GigCGigS SUM 0001000 sec 110 GBytes 942 Mbitssec senderSUM 0001000 sec 110 GBytes 942 Mbitssec receiver GigC  100MS 60 SUM 0001000 sec 114 MBytes 954 Mbitssec sender60 SUM 0001000 sec 113 MBytes 950 Mbitssec receiver I think Ill give the 2960c the benefit of the doubt

Nat overload and IPSLA,I have a Cisco ISR that I am trying to add two ISPs for basic internet traffic I configured IP sla and tracking so that when ISP1 fails ISP2 becomes the gateway of last resort This works exactly how I expect it However I am confused on how NAT plays into this setup I have a NAT overload configured on Gi000 for the primary But I cannot figure out how the second NAT overload can be placed on Gi001 when ISP1 fails Is there some sort of NAT tracking similar to how I can track with IP SLAs,You use the same NAT statmnet that you are using for ISP1 for ISP2 as well ip nat inside source routemap ISP1 interface gi000 overload ip nat inside source routemap ISP2 interface gi001 overload Asumming you have 2 default routes when the first one failes the second ISP should start forwarding traffic HTH RVCE I was assuming the same thing however here is the reply I get back Cannot change mappings interface name remove mapping first I technically do not have two default gateways since I am using IP tracking I have one GLR until it becomes unreachable then it gets replaced with the second GLR RVCE Why cant you add a second static route twards the second provider as well Assuming isp1 is primary and isp2 is backup ip route 0000 0000 isp1 ip route 0000 0000 isp2 10 This way the first one is your primary and the second one is on standby since it has higher admin to take over in case the first one fails HTH RVCE Reza Your configuration would work but the problem is ip route 0000 0000 isp1 Lets say the address for ISP1 is 3332 and my address interfacing that router is 3333 If ISP1 loses internet connectivity further down the LEC I would still be able to reach 3332 even though the internet is down due to a connection further along the communications chain Therefore my gateway would still point to this GLR and not the isp2 gateway with the higher metric This is why I am using IP sla So if I cannot ping say 8888 from my ISP1 interface then I deem that connection down and my routing table pulls 0000 0000 isp1 and replaces it with 0000 0000 isp2 10 All of this part explained above works however Im still at a lose with my NAT overload as I cannot add that state with this current configuration RVCE Hello in addition to Rezas remarks an alternative might be an EEM script that activates the backup interface and also clears the existing NAT translations Post the full config of your ISR so I can add the necessary bits and pieces for this approach RVCE Georg I think the EEM script may do the trick I could have a script pull the Current NAT statement and replace it with the ISP2 NAT However I would think with the nature of SLAs and IP tracking Cisco would have a way of dynamically updating NAT along SLA events RVCE Hello post the config you currently have At the very least the EEM script should clear the current NAT translations

Data Center Interconnect,I dont know how easy or hard this question is to answer without getting deep into details But here is what I am trying to accomplish I have or will have a data center and two collocations tied together with 10GB DWDM The DC will have a 10GB circuit to each collo and the two collos will be connected via 10GB as well I do not want to create a routed triangle by having the circuits each a L3 p2p I would like for the data center to have to L3 paths to each collo one direct and the other through the other collo So I need to have that collo xconnect between two physical circuits My question is what is the best way to do that Originally I was think I would just use an SVI on the L3 end point with a L2 vlan at the intermediate switch to do the xconnect but I am thinking this may not be the best approach Would EoMPLS or VPLS or something like that be a better solution I really dont know too much about either,Not exactly sure what you are trying to accomplish but I would assume one would want traffic going to the Collos to take the shortest and most direct path The routed triangle sounds the most efficient to me Anyhow yes if you made the links trunk links with VLANs passing through each Colo to the other across the inter Collo link yes you could achieve the desired result I would also prefer DWDM over a MPLS or VPLS solution as it eliminates the need to traverse a providers network Hope this helps RVCE What I am basically trying to accomplish is my DC having redundant paths to each collocation and all my WAN services upstream from the collos domestic WAN international WAN Internet etc but I also want to load share the traffic on those redundant links Each collo also has redundant WAN services When I started looking at the routed triangle solution I could see the potential for a lot fo routing loops and things like that without many benefits over the two collos not talking to each other So I am trying to get each collo to have two paths back to the DC one path is direct over DWDM and the other path is DWDM to the other collo one one circuit and xconnected to another DWDM circuit from that collo to my DC Its that transparent xconnect that I am trying to figure out the best way to approach RVCE So if I understand you correctly the two collos really dont need a direct connection to each other and you want each collo to have redundant equal cost links to the DC One being a direct DWDM connection and the other being a DWDM connection through the other collo Im sure that is possible I guess the question is how who or what is doing the DWDM piece

NBAR2 Protocol Pack and QoS,Hi AllWas just reading a old NBAR2 document relating to Protocol Pack 7 when I saw this note The RTP audiovideo subclassification parameters are generic in nature and will match only on generic RTP traffic More specific classification such as mslyncaudio ciscojabberaudio facetime and ciscophone will not match as RTP and therefore will not match the audiovideo subclassificationRef httpswwwciscocomcenustddocsiosxmliosqosnbarconfigurationxe3sqosnbarxe3sbooknbarprotoclpackhtml Can anyone speak more to this claim and if it is still valid I mean we are now way up on Protocol Pack 33 or 36 for Advanced but if match protocol rtp audio cant actually match stuff like ciscophone audio and ciscojabberaudio then its a pretty damming statement for Cisco and further proof that the entire AVCNBAR2 suite needs to be made a free feature of IPBase on all supported routers I mean I personally have configured heaps of routers with match protocol rtp audio under a classmap for voice and I am sure thousands of others have done it as well Hell I have had multiple Cisco Gold partners turn around and confirm this design and even specifically tell me that match protocol rtp audio will match Cisco IP phones and Cisco Jabber audio calls Am I getting worried over nothing or is this actually a huge gotcha that Cisco and partners alike have managed to overlook,I too recently read that and wondered on the same I was just on the verge of trying protocol rtp audio for Cisco VoIP phones but the need got eliminated so unfortunately I didnt find out If protocol rtp audio didnt work I was prepared to next try protocol rtpIn your reference right above that note mention was made it works if audio is related to SIP which would have also been true for me I too hope others post a response

BGP advertisements,Hi All Im trying to control BGP advertisements and I have two questions about the different possibilities a Is it any way to control the number of prefix to advertise to a neighbor by numberb Can I see the limit of prefixese stablished by my neighbor via maximunprefix from my device for example taking a look on debugs or something like that This is a question for IOS and ASR as well Thanks,I believe that the behavior of IOS and of ASR are similar a while you can control the number of prefixes that are received from a neighbor I do not believe that you can control by number the number of prefixes that you advertise to a neighbor b I do not know of a way to see the limit to number of prefixes established by a neighbor HTH Rick RVCE Hi Rick Bad Luckthank you anyway
CISCO ISR 4331 low WAN Speed,HelloThe provider delivers a speed 200 mbps and the ISR 4331 delivers a maximum of 100 mbpssh run sh int gi 000 PS Sorry for my English  Solved Go to Solution,Well the throughput is the issue If I understand correctly from the cisco page it should be the command platform hardware throughput level 300000 Assuming the license you have supports that if that doesnt work you might have to activateregister the license but i dont have any experience in that part httpswwwciscocomcenustddocsiosxmliosinterfacecommandircrbookiro1htmlwp3800310030 platform hardware throughput level To change the maximum throughput level on the virtual router use the platform hardware throughput level command in global configuration mode To return the platform throughput level to the

throughput level MB  10  100  1000  25  250  50  500  Syntax Description Cisco IOS XE Release 39S 10000 Sets the maximum throughput to 10000 Kbps 10 Mbps 25000 Sets the maximum throughput to 25000 Kbps 25 Mbps 50000 Sets the maximum throughput to 50000 Kbps 50 Mbps evalonly Specifies to use the maximum throughput for the evaluation license only Cisco IOS XE Release 310S 10 Sets the maximum throughput to 10 Mbps 100 Sets the maximum throughput to 100 Mbps 1000 Sets the maximum throughput to 1 Gbps 25 Sets the maximum throughput to 25 Mbps 250 Sets the maximum throughput to 250 Mbps 50 Sets the maximum throughput to 50 Mbps 500 Sets the maximum throughput to 500 Mbps Command Default The default maximum throughput level is determined by the installed base license Command Modes Global configuration config Command History Release Modification Cisco IOS XE Release 39S This command was introduced on the Cisco CSR 1000V Series Cloud Services Router Cisco IOS XE 310S The command was updated to change the keywords to units in Mbps and support for maximum throughput values of 100 Mbps 250 Mbps 500 Mbps and 1 Gbps was added Usage Guidelines The Cisco CSR 1000V requires the installation of base licenses that set the maximum throughput of the platform Depending on the configuration and the licenses installed you may need to manually increase or decrease the maximum throughput level on the Cisco CSR 1000V The maximum throughput on the router before the license is activated or if the license is invalidated is 25 Mbps When you install the base subscription license and accept the EULA the maximum throughput on the Cisco CSR 1000V will increase to the level allowed by the license You may need to manually change the maximum throughput level in the following cases If you are using an evaluation license When the evaluation license is first installed the maximum throughput is limited to 25 Mbps before the license is activated You must accept the EULA and enter the platform hardware throughput levelcommand to increase the maximum throughput When the 60day evaluation license expires the maximum throughput level reverts to 25 Mbps If you want to reduce the maximum throughput level from the maximum permitted by the installed licenses For example if you have the 50Mbps license installed and you want to reduce the maximum throughput to 25 Mbps You must enter the platform hardware throughput level command to reduce the maximum throughput If you previously changed the maximum throughput using the platform hardware throughput level command When you enter the command it becomes part of the configuration file You must enter the command again to change the maximum throughput level When changing the maximum throughput level you do not need to reboot the Cisco CSR 1000V for the change to take effect If you try to increase the throughput level higher than what the installed license supports you will receive an error message Examples The following example changes the maximum throughput level to 500 Mbps Routerconfig platform hardware throughput level MB 500 The following example changes the maximum throughput level to the default level supported by the installed license Routerconfig no platform hardware throughput level Related Commands Command Description show platform hardware throughput level Displays the current maximum

level on the virtual router use the platform hardware throughput level command in global configuration mode To return the platform throughput level to the default value use the no form of this command Cisco IOS XE Release 39S platform hardware throughput level  10000  25000  50000  evalonly  Cisco IOS XE Release 310S and Later platform hardware throughput level MB  10  100  1000  25  250  50  500  Syntax Description Cisco IOS XE Release 39S 10000 Sets the maximum throughput to 10000 Kbps 10 Mbps 25000 Sets the maximum throughput to 25000 Kbps 25 Mbps 50000 Sets the maximum throughput to 50000 Kbps 50 Mbps evalonly Specifies to use the maximum throughput for the evaluation license only Cisco IOS XE Release 310S 10 Sets the maximum throughput to 10 Mbps 100 Sets the maximum throughput to 100 Mbps 1000 Sets the maximum throughput to 1 Gbps 25 Sets the maximum throughput to 25 Mbps 250 Sets the maximum throughput to 250 Mbps 50 Sets the maximum throughput to 50 Mbps 500 Sets the maximum throughput to 500 Mbps Command Default The default maximum throughput level is determined by the installed base license Command Modes Global configuration config Command History Release Modification Cisco IOS XE Release 39S This command was introduced on the Cisco CSR 1000V Series Cloud Services Router Cisco IOS XE 310S The command was updated to change the keywords to units in Mbps and support for maximum throughput values of 100 Mbps 250 Mbps 500 Mbps and 1 Gbps was added Usage Guidelines The Cisco CSR 1000V requires the installation of base licenses that set the maximum throughput of the platform Depending on the configuration and the licenses installed you may need to manually increase or decrease the maximum throughput level on the Cisco CSR 1000V The maximum throughput on the router before the license is activated or if the license is invalidated is 25 Mbps When you install the base subscription license and accept the EULA the maximum throughput on the Cisco CSR 1000V will increase to the level allowed by the license You may need to manually change the maximum throughput level in the following cases If you are using an evaluation license When the evaluation license is first installed the maximum throughput is limited to 25 Mbps before the license is activated You must accept the EULA and enter the platform hardware throughput levelcommand to increase the maximum throughput When the 60day evaluation license expires the maximum throughput level reverts to 25 Mbps If you want to reduce the maximum throughput level from the maximum permitted by the installed licenses For example if you have the 50Mbps license installed and you want to reduce the maximum throughput to 25 Mbps You must enter the platform hardware throughput level command to reduce the maximum throughput If you previously changed the maximum throughput using the platform hardware throughput level command When you enter the command it becomes part of the configuration file You must enter the command again to change the maximum throughput level When changing the maximum throughput level you do not need to reboot the Cisco CSR 1000V for the change to take effect If you try to increase the throughput level higher than what the installed license supports you will receive an error message Examples The following example changes the maximum throughput level to 500 Mbps Routerconfig platform hardware throughput level MB 500 The following example changes the maximum throughput level to the default level supported by the installed license Routerconfig no platform

Cisco 4331 router  No internet access,Dear readersI am running into an issue we are replacing a draytek router model 2130 with a Cisco 4331 routerThe internal network is working fine but I cant seem to get the internet workingI tried searching the forums and looked up multiple Cisco router wan basic setup guides but no success yetThe details that I knowCisco port G000 IP 583216230 EDIT was 32 but should be 30Cisco port G001 IP 1921681005024 that is connected to a 48 port switchDNS servers of the webprovider are 1782178081 and 1782178180 I copied the settings of from the draytek our provider says that is all and that there are no hidden settings that are required aka usernamespasswordsWhen i use the webinterface to do a WAN connection test I get a green checkmark on everything except the ping to 8888I have added in a text file the output of show ip route and show conf since in similar issues that are the most requested outputs at the start Does anyone maybe see what I am overlookingThank you all in advance for your time Solved Go to Solution,Hi Will you please change your default route configuration as follows ip route 0000 0000 5832161 Best regards Antonin RVCE Hello you say that your provider has given you IP 583216232 however you have configured 30 Try interface GigabitEthernet000 ip address 5832162 255255255254 or interface GigabitEthernet000ip address 5832162

to mention one important part we will start working in the future with vlans that will come on 19216850 but that isnt in use yet our entire network at this moment is on 19216810024 The 583216230 is copied from the draytek I added a screenshot of the its WAN configuration page I will do the changes you mentioned straight away sadly because of work hours the draytek is connected again and cant test Will come back to you as soon as possible EDIT just noticed the mistake in the opening post edited it sorry for the confusion RVCE Dear Georg I have changed the settings as recommended but still cant ping 8888 from the router and cant ping 5832162 from the outside Added the new show conf file Is there maybe anything that you still recommend Thank you for all your help RVCE Hi HADES2001 Are you able to ping default gateway5832161 from your router If not then check the interface status like speed and duplex SDWAN SpecialistSpooster IT Services RVCE Hi Will you please change your default route configuration as follows ip route 0000 0000 5832161 Best regards Antonin RVCE Thank you all so much for the help I added ip route 0000 0000 5832161 also removed the spanningtree portfast trunk on port g000 The webinterface wont let me do the WAN test anymore because it keeps saying there is no port configured as WAN anymore But besides that internet is working the port forwards arent working yet so our internal applications cant be accessed from the outside but since we now have internet access and the IP phones are working I can easily sit down for that without having short time frames again thank you all for the assistance hope i gave the helpfull stars away in the proper way new to these forums RVCE Hello take the spanningtree portfast trunk off the outside interface and

post from the original poster I have changed the settings as recommended but still cant ping 8888 from the router if the router can not ping an Internet IP address then that is the first problem that we need to solve Any of the other suggestions about the config should wait till this is solved Having suggested that other topics should wait I feel that I must say that I agree with Antonin that the default route pointing just to Gig000 may be problematic And that is not what the Draytek was using A default route specifying the next hop address or perhaps both outbound interface and next hop address is better and is what the Draytek was using HTH Rick RVCE Having read through the thread again and thinking about the issue I would suggest that the first step should be to find out if the router can ping 5832161 If not then I would ask for the original poster to post the output of the command show ip interface brief HTH Rick RVCE Dont worry I am still here sadly I am stuck on very short time frames because the employees require internet access setting alarm extra early to test all the help just posted internet access is the primary target all other things are on hold Project managers tend to forget that 9 women cant bear a child in 1 months i truelly appreciate all the help from everyone here and will let everyone know tomorrow what the results are

BGP Advertisement,All could you please let me know how to advertise these subnets on BGP attached diagram My understanding is have a static route from the firewall for 1721616024 poitning back to 1010102 and advertise that static route via routemap through ebgp Solved Go to Solution,now will i need a routemap to limit what advertisements i receive  is that a must ANS It is not a must but depending on your environment it is not a bad idea If you know what you are expecting to receive it cant hurt to avoid getting advertisements you dont want It doesnt necessarily have to be done with route maps either You can filter with ACLs aspath prefixlists etc do i need a routemap to limit what i send or is the network statement enough to cover this ANS The network statement should suffice but there is nothing wrong with adding another level of control to avoid advertising anything you dont want Again it doesnt only have to be done with a route map RVCE Simply put for a network to be advertised in BGP it needs to exist in some form The static route to 1010102 meets this requirement You could redistribute the static via BGP or even simpler you could just add it as a network statement in BGP Either one should work Hope this helps RVCE will it work if i add it as a network statement under BGP as the network itself does NOT hang off the firewall is this the same case if it was ospf as well RVCE For BGP to advertise a network it needs to see it in the IGP static EIGRP OSPF etc So as stated earlier the network statement or redistribution of static would work For OSPF to advertise a network with a network statement it needs to be an attached network If it is based on a static route it has to be redistributed as the network statement would not apply Hope that clarifies things RVCE now will i need a routemap to limit what advertisements i receive  is that a must and do i need a routemap to limit what i send or is the network statement enough to cover this RVCE now will i need a routemap to limit what advertisements i receive  is that a must ANS It is not a must but depending on your environment it is not a bad idea If you know what you are expecting to receive it cant hurt to avoid getting advertisements you dont want It doesnt necessarily have to be done with route maps either You can filter with ACLs aspath prefixlists etc do i need a routemap to limit what i send or is the network statement enough to cover this ANS The network statement should suffice but there is nothing wrong with adding another level of control to avoid advertising anything you dont want Again it doesnt only have to be done with a route map RVCE Thanks
EIGRP  adding backup routing,I am distributing static routes into eigrpat two sites Specifically we are using NSX and SRM so that certain VMs have the same IP address at each site Main and Backup At Main I have two sets of IP addresses with a default route to each subnetip route 10010024 1020295ip route 10011024 1020295 At Backup we have the same subnets but want to inject route or influence routing via eigrp so that when Main site goes darkdown the following routes would take over automaticallyip route 10010024 1020395ip route 10011024 1020395 Solved Go to Solution,I think the simplest way to accomplish this would be to just administratively weigh the statics at the backup site to something higher than the redistributed statics 170 at the primary site So then ip route 10010024 1020395 200 ip route 10011024 1020395 200 As long as the primary routes are active and in the routing table these routes shouldnt propagate Once the primary site is offline the secondary routes would then be advertised RVCE Evaluate which one suits your circumstances from the following options 1Embedded Event Manager EEM  Use EEM to track the routing table If the route is not present and learned via EIGRP EEM installs the static route and redistribute via EIGRP 2 Static route tracking using IP SLA  Configure the static routes with IP SLA The use of IP SLA is to monitor the reachability of a particular hosts If the host is not reachable the static route would not be installed in the routing table and thus would not be redistributed to EIGRP 3 Advertise both subnets from main and backup sites but make sure the backup site has higher EIGRP metric set HTH Please rate replies and mark question as answered if applicable RVCE I think it would be best to use number 3 setting a higher metric for the backup site routes but I am not sure what metric to change Is not the default metric for eigrp 10000 1 255 1 1500 So what would I need to change to make this happen This is what I have in my config currently router eigrp 128 distributelist statictoeigrp out static network 10000 redistribute static metric 10000 1 255 1 1500 passiveinterface default no passiveinterface Vlan364 no passiveinterface Vlan368 eigrp stub connected static summary Thanks RVCE It would be best to increase the value of the delay metric from the default to a higher value HTH Rick RVCE Please can you be more specific what higher value might be and how I would add it into the configThanks RVCE In EIGRP redistribute default metric the second value represents the delay You currently have this redistribute static metric 10000 1 255 1 1500 I would suggest that you change it to this redistribute static metric 10000 100 255 1 1500 HTH Rick RVCE But only want to apply the higher metric to these routes not my whole eigrp redistributionip route 10010024 1020395ip route 10011024 1020395 RVCE If you want to change the metric on some but not all redistributed static routes then you need to use a route map to control your redistribution In one instance of the route map you would match these routes and redistribute with the higher value of delay and in another instance of the route map you would match the remaining routes and redistribute them with the lower value of delay HTH Rick RVCE Please could you provide an example I have yet to use route maps RVCE Hi Here is an example to use to redistribute using routemap routemap STATICTOEIGRP permit 10 match ip address 101 match ip nexthop 10 set metric 100000 100 255 1 1500 exit routemap STATICTOEIGRP permit 20 set metric 100000 1 255 1

Meheretab RVCE I think the simplest way to accomplish this would be to just administratively weigh the statics at the backup site to something higher than the redistributed statics 170 at the primary site So then ip route 10010024 1020395 200 ip route 10011024 1020395 200 As long as the primary routes are active and in the routing table these routes shouldnt propagate Once the primary site is offline the secondary routes would then be advertised RVCE The common way to manipulate redistributed routes is to use route maps The solution suggested by Chris is very creative wish I had thought of it So 5 for it It achieves the desired result without the complexity of using route maps HTH Rick RVCE Thank you Richard I appreciate that RVCE Thank you for your extremely helpful solution and dialogue which give me a better understanding of my network I went with Chriss solution RVCE I am glad that our discussion has been helpful and that you have a better understanding of your network as a result of it The solution from Chris is simple and effective This reminds us that frequently there may be more than one way to solve a problem One of the excellent things about these forums is that we have multiple people looking at the issues and potentially suggesting alternative solutions HTH Rick
Mesh Convergence with WLC 5508  2504 with 1552S Access Points,I have two different setups with WLC 5508 and WLC 2504 with 8 1552S Access Points2 RAPs are connected to the switch  6 MAPs are in 80211a mesh max 2 hopsThe WLC 5508 or WLC 2504 is running with 831330 firmwareMesh Convergence is configured as Very Fast I am observing that whenever I switch OFF one of the RAPs especially the RAP with which all the MAPs have active links during mesh convergence all the MAPs drop from the network even though their inactive link with the other RAP has good SNR they rejoin the network with active links with RAP2 I expect that the mesh convergence should be seamless  the MAPs should not drop when one of the RAPs is switched OFF Can anyone guide me to as what is going wrong Is there any configuration that I have missed Or is this an expected behavior,

rv130 access rules,I Use a Cisco RV130 small business router for the protecting my network My internal network is accessible for specific external networksWithin the RV130 router firewall I set up access rules to allow access to specific network ports from these networks see the list at the bottom of my question The last 4 access rules were put in to block all other external traffic from using the service ports in questionEverything worked perfectly until I did a firmware updateon the router to the latest version 10322 2 days agoNow when the block rules are enabled all external traffic is being blocked from using the serviceThe only way for me to get thing working again is to disable the block rules but this causes a vulnerability in my networkbecause the specific services are now open for all external networksCan anyone help me resolve this issueAccess Rules Always allow Rsync2 Enabled Inbound WAN  LAN xxxx xxxx Always Always allow FTP Enabled Inbound WAN  LAN xxxx xxxx Always Always allow RTRR Enabled Inbound WAN  LAN xxxx xxxx Always Always allow Rsync2 Enabled Inbound WAN  LAN xxxx xxxx Always Always allow Rsync2 Enabled Inbound WAN  LAN xxxx xxxx Always Always allow Rsync2 Enabled Inbound WAN  LAN xxxx xxxx Always Always allow RTRR Enabled Inbound WAN  LAN xxxx xxxx Always Always allow Rsync2 Enabled Inbound WAN  LAN xxxx xxxx Always Always allow Rsync2 Enabled Inbound WAN  LAN xxxx xxxx Always Always allow All Traffic Enabled Inbound WAN  LAN xxxx xxxx Always Always allow All Traffic Enabled Inbound WAN  LAN xxxx xxxx Always Always block Rsync Enabled Inbound WAN  LAN Any xxxx Always Always block Rsync2 Enabled Inbound WAN  LAN Any xxxx Always Always block RTRR Enabled Inbound WAN  LAN Any xxxx Always Always block FTP Enabled Inbound WAN  LAN Any xxxx Always,Hello the bug below might apply The workaround is to downgrade to 1027 or to disable the block ACL RV130x Block Access Rule blocks traffic that should be AllowedCSCuz56638DescriptionSymptom If an Allow ACL has been configured to allow traffic from a specific hostnetwork and then a Block ACL is configured the Block ACL will block traffic that is supposed to be Allowed This is seen even when Allow ACL is ordered first Conditions Allow ACL is configured Block ACL is configured Seen in 10314 Workaround Disable the Block ACL Downgrade to 1027 RVCE Hello Georg Thank you for your reply I will do a downgrade to different previous versions of the firmware asap to see whether or not the issue has been resolved I will get report back once the FW downgrades have been installed Ok just to give you an update You were spot on with your solution only when downgrading to version 1027 thing started working again Unfortunately every 103x firmware has this issue Hopefully Cisco wille Resolve this issue in future firmware updates for the RV130 Thanx for your help RVCE Hi AllI can confirm this ACL bug to CSCuz56638 in many of the last firmware versions even the last one 10328 still has this bugI had also many issues with the original factory based firmware most isues where fixed in 103XXBut in 103XX there is this ACL bug and for this i was forced to go back to the old firmware But they had other problems like1027 i have single port mappings and access rules enabled when i click on reorder and want to move access rule 45 to place 34 and i click save then the rv130s webserver crashes and a reconnect fom the webbrowser does not work anymore a reboot of the device is then requiredfurther 2 request for the engineering department1in all firmware versions with the inside WANLAN allow access rule i can specify only a single ip and not a range of ip adresses it would be very handy to allow this functionwithout this i have to make many single rules one for every ip2a single port mapping does now allow by default a port to be open for every onebetter is to seperate those so that for every single port mapping an access rule is required and its not opened by default to the worldRegardsSander Eerkes RVCE I have five of these on the latest firmware with a similar problem Cant downgrade them without visiting the sites because the firware upgrade buttons are all greyed out RVCE Yes i know In the lastest firmware the problem still exist but no sign of Cisco cisco please fix this problem that already exist for a long period of time to long

Upgrading Cisco 2960X stack,Im having trouble finding any decent guides to upgrading a 2960X stack with the BIN file The official Cisco guide goes over the process with the TAR file but its not the same Wondering if anyone has had any experience with the BIN upgrade process Based off of bits and pieces of articles that I found on Google heres how I see the process going for our 4switch stack1 Copy the BIN file to the flash directory of EACH switch in the stack copy ftp flash1 copy ftp flash2 copy ftp flash3 copy ftp flash42 Upgrade the Master switch 1 switch first Save and reload the device boot system switch all flashbinfilenamebin3 Upgrade the other switches one at a time archive copysw forcereload overwrite dest 2 1 archive copysw forcereload overwrite dest 3 1 archive copysw forcereload overwrite dest 4 14 Verify all switches upgraded post their rebootsSeems time intensive but I dont see any other way to do the upgrade Anyone else Thank youLK Solved Go to Solution,As I understand it the best way would be to use the TAR file But if not unfortunately you have to copy the BIN file to each switch in the stack Once the file is copied just type the reload command and you should see the new image being installed on all switches in the stack Reference httpwwwciscocomcenussupportdocsswitchescatalyst3750seriesswitches64898upgrade3750stackhtmlcfbin1 B RVCE Hello Actually using bin file is quite easy As you mentioned you need to copy bin file to the flash Then use show flash to make sure file exists Then conf t boot system FlashIOSnamebin WR reload the master and slaves after Just make sure you have the latest backup of the configuration and also one copy of current working IOS just in case Masoud RVCE As I understand it the best way would be to use the TAR file But if not unfortunately you have to copy the BIN file to each switch in the stack Once the file is copied just type the reload command and you should see the new image being installed on all switches in the stack Reference httpwwwciscocomcenussupportdocsswitchescatalyst3750seriesswitches64898upgrade3750stackhtmlcfbin1 B RVCE Thanks bolds04 RVCE Hello Actually using bin file is quite easy As you mentioned you need to copy bin file to the flash Then use show flash to make sure file exists Then conf t boot system FlashIOSnamebin WR reload the master and slaves after Just make sure you have the latest backup of the configuration and also one copy of current working IOS just in case Masoud RVCE Thanks that seems straightforward and wasnt sure why it was all so confusing in the beginning RVCE You are welcome It looks confusing because there are several switches involved but it is pretty easy Masoud RVCE This should be enough see below Just make sure you use the boot system switch all This is critical It changes the boot variable on all switches see show boot Without switch all only the master boot variable is changed if you reload then only the master will run the new version and all the other will have a version mismatch status in the stack 1 Copy the BIN file to the flash directory of EACH switch in the stack  copy ftp flash1  copy ftp flash2  copy ftp flash3  copy ftp flash4 2 This command on the master  boot system switch all flashbinfilenamebin 3 reload RVCE Thanks gnijs Did this exact method yesterday during our upgrades and worked like a charm RVCE Actually if you need to save on bandwidth you can just copy it once to the flash and then you copy it internally from flash to each stack members flash If the stack is set up in correct order the master will be switch 1 simply copy therefore from flash to flash2 flash3 and so on By the way a super easy way to copy directly onto your cisco device without messing around with TFTP infrastructure is the use of SCP 1 Download PSCP  a small standalone exe file like calcexe and your IOS into the same folder on your computer 2 On your switches enable the following command and save conf t ip scp server enable 3 Run a command shell cmd on your computer go to your folder where IOS and PSCP are located 4 Copy with the following syntax to your device pscp scp ios file name userdevice name or ipios file name 5 When prompted enter your password and the copy process starts 6 Relax enjoy a coffee  You can copy like this on a stack and it will be automatically placed onto flash Distributed then from there internally to all stack members Oh and if you need to update lots of machines like i do simply run 30 or 40 cmd shells in parallel

QoS  Exchange on MPLS,We recently went through a few upgrades at our CORP center make a long story short we are seeing high bandwidth utilization and latency at remote branch locations when a user opens up their Outlook client to download their mailboxcaching mode is off by defaultThe exchange backend sits at our CORP center which connects to our MPLS 50Mbps the branch however only have a 6Mbps pipe to the MPLS Ive played around with applying a policymap at the branch but I still see high utilization Would one be better off applying a policymap close the Exchange backend before it gets on to the MPLS or does anyone have any suggestions,If your equipment supports it you should have a policy map at both the CORP site and branch sites on devices sending traffic to MPLS On the CORP side you should also shape for the downstream branch bandwidth If the aggregate of your branches can exceed 50 Mbps you may need to shape there tooIf your WAN MPLS is 3rd party you might also investigate what QoS feature they support if any RVCE We only have currently a policymap across all locations is 40 for VOIP traffic Our WAN MPLS provider is using standard QoS markings So if I understand you correctlywe wanted to use 20 of the line for Exchange traffic I would implement a policymap at a remote location with a bandwidth of 6mbps using the following ip accesslist extended EXCHANGE permit ip any host ExchangeServers classmap EXCHANGE match accessgroup name EXCHANGE policymap QoSOUT class EXCHANGE police 1200000 conformaction transmit exceedaction drop On the CORP location use something similar with 20 of the 50mbps line used for Exchange traffic RVCE  Our WAN MPLS provider is using standard QoS markingsOh what standard the RFC What exactly do they do per markingWhat are your devices and their IOS versions being used both at CORP and your branches Could you post what youre using now for policies on both sides

nat uturn or pbr loopback,Hello team I know this is a topic that is very much discussed but it is simple killing me There are 2 sites 1 with Cisco router 18xx and one with a Vigor3200 one site has teh 1921681024 and the other 9024 as internal IPsNow for SOME reason on the Vigor Side they decided to connect the Cisco with the Vigor thoughout a Switch and as this want enough the decided to put the 19216810 as WAN interface on VIGOR that hits a Provider Modem with Default Gateway or 1254 which is the same network in cisco Fa00 Funny thing they toldthey want these 2 network to communicate with each otherhahahaAs cisco has internal lan 19216810 and Vigor uses the same range in it WAN LOLI dont want to tell them to simple re plan their network I am trying to figure out a Gyro Solution where simple create a Sub interface on Fa00100 as a 10001 and to Vigor Lan2 10002 and somehow put a static route on Vigor that 19216810 is out of 10001 But it wont take it as 1921681024 is used by Vigor in WAN1  But here is what I am thinking Could I create a loopback on Cisco 1111 and static ip route to vigor 1111 from 10001 which it works and pingable but how can I re route the traffic from the Loopback to 19216810 internal Lan of Cisco 16810Lan 19216890lan Vigor 19216810 Wan1 VigorCisco  Switch  Vigor,Hello how are the two sites connected by VPN  What is the WAN IP address of the Cisco side  RVCE This is the most Weid network Topology i have ever seen so far So let me try and explain  Cisco  Comapny 1 Switch Company 1 Computers 1921681024 Vigor Company 2 Cisco Interface 1 inside LAN 1921681024 Vigor To Oxygen Modem 1921681100  Oxygen MOdem 1921681254 Vigor Inside Lan Computers 1921689024 CiscoSwitchVigorOxygen Modem  So because I do not wish to change all of their network and their IPs when I am trying to do is to advertise Cisco network 19216810 to vigor and 19216890 From Vigor to Cisco Network So I created a sub interface on cisco 10001 and an interface on Vigor 10002 I have put a static route on Cisco of 19216890 out of 10002 On Vigor though I cannot Add a static route of 19216810 out of 10001 because it already has a directly connected route to Wan for Oxygen Modem  So I thought why not create a Loopback interface on Cisco and put that as a static route on Vigor So yes a loopback interface with a different Private IP is able to communicate with Company 2 network and the other way around What I am thinking is what if I can somehow make the 19216810 from Cisco PBR route map through out the Loopback interface So 19216890 can reach the Loopback and the loopback can reroute the traffic to 19216810 Cisco is connected through the internet through another Wan Line plus a Dialer as a backup They dont want to use VPN between companies because they say that since it is Directly connected 1 network with the other we could advertise the networks through static routes But they will need to change the Oxygen Modem IP and therefore the Default Gateway Meaning Downtime So what do you think  Confused yet RVCE Hello what device is the layer 3 routing currently configured on at Company 1  You say there is a switch which IP address if the default gateway for the client computers and where is it configured  Company 1 LAN 1921681024    Company 2 RVCE Company 1 has the Cisco which is Connected to a Switch which all their computers are connected which then they connected an interface of that Switch to the Company 2 VigorDefault gateway for the clients is from what I see from configuration 19216811 for Company 1On company 2 some PCs are going out from

76EST4TG weired lost packet problem on 7609,Dear SirMadam we are using 76EST4TG card in slot 9 and slot 3 91 interface facing core router  32 interface facing customer switch we config a 900 entries ACL on interface 91 incoming direction and protect our customers from attacks now we found some problem we ping directly connected Layer3 neighbor on 7609 is ok but we ping customers under 32 interface from upper layer 3 core router  it lost packets we found packet is send out uper core router to 7609 91 interfacebut some packets not send out 32 interface we ping 100 packet only found 91 packets send out 32 teng interface to customers ios version is supbootdiskc7600rsp72043advipservicesmz12233SRD4bin and we test again on a router directly connected 31 interfacesame slot of interface 32 and no acl config under 31 ping is ok it seems some problem of forwarding problem inside 76EST4TG line card  it is weired thank youTom,Tom it may be that the packets are punted to RP CPU for forwarding Check the HW CEF entry for the destination IP address to see whether its correct You can also try to capture one incoming ping packets from core router using ELAM to see what decision the HW makes For more advanced troubleshooting it would be the best if you could open a TAC SR The IOS release running on this router has reached end of support We suggest upgrading to the latest Safe Harbour release Aleksandar RVCE Hi Aleksandar Thank you for your kindly help sorry for the delay I tested many times recently I send 100 packets from upper router which directly connected to 7609 ES card interface and config acl on the 7609 ES layer 3 interface input direction and I found upper router send 100 packets out  and on 7609 acl hit counts I only found 91 hits so I sniffer on downside port connected to downside server i found 91 packets out to server ad 91 packets came back  So maybe 76 ES card has some bug but I didnt find any match bug i havent capture packet to RP CPU because on ES card interface input direction I found acl hit account indicate es card lost some packets becauset out of contract  I cant open case thank you Tom RVCE Hi Aleksandar Thank you for your kindly help

Doesnt this test imply that you should also check whats happening on the upstream router RVCE yes we capture packet on upstream switch interface directly connected we found 100 packets send out from upstream router  this is weired there is no crc problem and other interface erros on both interface of 7609 and upstream router may be we need a inline fiber sniffer detector like netcout product this

testing disable the ACLQoS configured on the IF and check the result  Also when you see loss of ICMP packets ping  can you check the output of  show platform hardware drops multiple times to see any drop counters incrementing Best Regards Hari RVCE we can ping directly connected updown switch and router and no packet loss but when we try to ping through from up router to downstream switch it is lost packets we sniffer on interface to downstream router found send 91 packets and returnk 91 packets there no problem from 7609 to downstream switch bug from upstream router we can sniffer 100

Which DMVPN hub router 85Mbps encrypted traffic,Hello Im looking for advice on a hub router for traffic that bursts above 85Mbps its drops packets during high usage times We currently have a 2951 router and are looking at getting an HSEC license to increase the throughput for our DMVPN tunnel that connects almost 20 small 110 employee branches and a couple of large 2575 employee offices Ive been looking at some documentation but havent found good info on practical throughput of a 2951 with an HSEC license Is it worth it Or should we look into a 4xxx series Thanks,
Counter for DF packets dropped,Hi everyone ive a questione for you if i send a packet with the dont fragment flag in the ip header and the MTU is not as high as the size of the packet eg packet size 2900  MTU 1600 is there a counter that i can see increasing is there any debug that can help me maybe filtering some kind of traffic with ACLsThank you very muchRegards Lorenzo Solved Go to Solution,Hi You can use Debug IP packet details ACL It is commanded to use with ACL with limited test traffic only otherwise it will take a lot of resources of your router Regards Deepak Kumar RVCE Hi You can use Debug IP packet details ACL It is commanded to use with ACL with limited test traffic only otherwise it will take a lot of resources of your router Regards Deepak Kumar
Using a ROUTEMAP in Advertising Networks into BGP  Help needed,Hi all Im looking to use a PrefixList and RouteMap for controlling the networks being advertised into BGP out to an MPLS network Of course I could simply do router bgp 65000network 10100 mask 25525500network 101100 mask 25525500neighbor  However can the networks be put into a PrefixList and RouteMap  I know I can add a RouteMap to a Neighbor xxxxxxxx but Im assuming that this is just filtering the networks without actually advertising them Therefore could I change the network statements to network 10000 mask 255000 and then add 10100 and 101100 to a routemap  Im just looking for a simple and easy way to control subnets being advertised while providing a very descriptive method which will make it very easy for anyone in the future to follow as to what is going on  Solved Go to Solution,Hi How would I best advertise everything in BGP out to the MPLS on the basis that everything in BGP has been redistributed from EIGRP into BGP from the Lan  I am sorry but I am not sure what you are asking about Can you perhaps try rewording your question Either way once routes have been injected into BGP whether through network commands or through redistribute commands they will automatically be advertised from your router to all its BGP peers without further configuration In IOS there is nothing you need to configure on top to get the routes injected into BGP on your router to be advertised further Please feel welcome to ask further Best regardsPeter RVCE Hello The approach of network 10000 mask 255000  would not work because in BGP the network command has to match the networktobeadvertised exactly This is different to IGP protocols where you could configure a large network and all directly connected network falling under it would get advertised However the networks you want to advertise in BGP are already present in your routing table from another source  perhaps directly connected perhaps from an IGP What would typically be done in these cases is a simple redistribution  redistribute connected routemap  or redistribute eigrp 1 routemap  and the referenced routemap would then refer to the ACL or prefixlist that would select the appropriate networks to be advertised So instead of naming the networks one by one you would have them redistributed and in the redistribute command you would use the routemap to pick the routes youre interested in redistributing and thus advertising in BGP Do you think this would be a viable approach for you Best regardsPeter RVCE Thanks for that How would I best advertise everything in BGP out to the MPLS on the basis that everything in BGP has been redistributed from EIGRP into BGP from the Lan  RVCE Hi How would I best advertise everything in BGP out to the MPLS on the basis that everything in BGP has been redistributed from EIGRP into BGP from the Lan  I am sorry but I am not sure what you are asking about Can you perhaps try rewording your question Either way once routes have been injected into BGP whether through network commands or through redistribute commands they will automatically be advertised from your router to all its BGP peers without further configuration In IOS there is nothing you need to configure on top to get the routes injected into BGP on your router to be advertised further Please feel welcome to ask further Best regardsPeter RVCE Sorry to resurrect this again after such a lapse in time Its not working for me at all For instance if I remove the line network 10250102 mask 255255255255then this drops out of the local BGP Topology table and stops advertising router bgp 65000 bgp logneighborchanges neighbor xxxxxxxx remoteas yyyy  addressfamily ipv4 network 101010 mask 2552552550 network 1010110 mask 2552552550 network 10250102 mask 255255255255 router loopback interface redistribute eigrp 100 routemap SENDTOBGP neighbor xxxxxxxx activate neighbor xxxxxxxx routemap NGNMSVCBGPIN in neighbor xxxxxxxx routemap NGNMSVCBGPOUT out exitaddressfamilyip prefixlist SENDTOBGP seq 10 permit 101011024ip prefixlist SENDTOBGP seq 20 permit 10101024ip prefixlist SENDTOBGP seq 30 permit 1025010232routemap NGNMSVCBGPOUT permit 10 match ip address prefixlist SENDTOBGP set aspath prepend 65000 65000 RVCE Hello Not a problem  please apologize my late response Hmmm If removing any network command causes the network to drop out from BGP then the redistribution is not really working as expected obviously Quickly checking your configuration you have posted however I do not see any routemap SENDTOBGP present I see a prefixlist of that name but no routemap Perhaps thats the problem in your configuration Can you try adding this to your config routemap SENDTOBGP permit 10 match ip address prefixlist SENDTOBGP Best regardsPeter RVCE I hadnt realized that I had the routemap pointing at the ip prefixlist However I have fixed that and it still wont work I tried clear ip bgp  soft too but no joy
Problem to upload qcow2 file into Cisco ENCS 5412,Morning I have a cisco ENCS5412 and I fail to load a 12 Gb qcow2 file It is to create a VM packageHow to do this uploading The version of NFVIS is 371 Thanks,Under VM Life Cycle  Image Repository  Image Packaging Click the blue  symbol and it will give you an option to upload your qcow2 and set the options for your package Alternatively you can download the nfvptpy tool from VM Life Cycle  Image Repository  Browse Datastore  Data  intdatastore  Uploads  vmpackagingutility  nfvisvmpackagingtooltar Once you unpack the tarball you can use nfvptpy to package your VM offline and then upload the package which will be in a targz format to the image registration page RVCE the size of the qcow2 file exceeds 6GIts possible RVCE I packaged a 10GB qcow2 offline with the nfvptpy vm packing tool and uploaded the resulting targz to the image repository with no problems RVCE I will try but here is the error that appears
OSPF Authentication,To enable OSPF MD5 authentication is it necessary to run it under all interfaces of a router If I dont enable it under a interface and enable it under router process and rest of the interfaceswill that interfaces network will not be advertised to the rest of the network eg if a LAN switch is connected to an interface on which users are connected and I dont enable authn on that typical interface then ,Its not mandatory that all interface should run authentication even if u have configured under the ospf processbut its mandatory that it must be configured on all neighbors reached through that interfaceotherwise adjacency will not be formedarun RVCE HiHere is an example Sample Configuration for Authentication in OSPF httpwwwciscocomenUStechtk365technologiesconfigurationexample09186a0080094069shtmlIf I understand well your question the answer is The network will be advertised the method for not advertise the network is by route mapthat is a selection of routes that must be advertisedI hope this helpsBest regardsMassimiliano RVCE hiThe authentication type must be the same for all routers and access servers in an area The authentication password for all OSPF routers on a network must be the same if they are to communicate with each other via OSPF Use the ip ospf authenticationkey interface command to specify this passwordIf you enable MD5 authentication with the messagedigest keyword you must configure a password with the ip ospf messagedigestkey interface commandTo remove the authentication specification for an area use the no form of this command with the authentication keywordYou typically enable authentication for a area not for specific interfaceThe authentication affects the communication between the routers of the authenticated areanot between the users and switchesHTHregardsshri  RVCE Hi Im facing issues between IOS XR and IOS XE for OSPF AUTH In IOS XE there is only init state for IOS XR in debug I only see the Hello Packets Have you any idea I verified using the same MD5 key in both nodesRegards RVCE Hello do you have are or interface authentication configured

Voip quality problems on 1841 iOS 124,Hi We have a branch office in Cologne and is WAN connected by a cisco 1841 ios 124Sometimes people experience quality problems during a conversationThere is no more than voip phones and thinclients for RDP traffic to the main office using a 50Mb lineThis config is running a few years now made by somebody who left the company but i have heard from the users that there always were voip quality problemsI post the config file and hope you can give me some insights in if I can improve the setup which in general must be very basic so just act as a branch router for using RDP clients and voip dataHope to hear some dos and donts and off course the no gos in this config Building configurationCurrent configuration  16396 bytesversion 124no service

venture to say your QoS might be a bit suboptimalFirst understand for QoS to be most effective it often needs an egress configuration on both sides of a link Second if an interface provides more physical bandwidth than is known to be available along the path you also need to shape for the available bandwidthYour service policies allocate 75 of the bandwidth for PQ Cisco recommends you dont exceed 33 for PQ Some of the traffic thats being sent to PQ shouldnt go there RVCE Hi Can you share the output from show policymap int f00 out and show policymap int f01 out we would like to see if you have any VOIP matches httpswwwciscocomcenussupportdocsqualityofserviceqosqoscongestionavoidance10107showpolicyhtml Regards Alex Please rate useful posts RVCE Hi Alex Used your commands but I get 0

to use a hierarchal poliicy with shaper Also I believe many Cisco shapers and policers dont account for L2 overhead and if your device doesnt you also want to shape about 15 slower than your nominal bandwidthI see youre using randomdetect I generally recommend not using it unless youre a QoS expertAssuming you dont need to allow for L2 overhead something likeclassmap matchall Voicematch dscp

Not sure how big of a branch office it is but 33 percent in the priority class for voip would be 3 meg which is approximately 60 active calls Then again if you dont use it it is available so it really

on the most effective qos for my branch  branch has 66 Employees thanks all RVCE What I suggested in my first post should be effective again though you may want to reduce the shapers CIR by about 15As to most effective theres insufficient information RVCE Hello joseph I dont see you added class for SQL aka DB and Application with necessary Bandwidth reservation  if i the branch got congested somehow then users wont be able to make transaction to DB and APP at HQ  thus customers will be angry from delay of service thanks RVCE Correct and as I posted earlierNB you can include DBAPAccess class but with FQ in classdefault you may not need itFQ often does a nice job of insuring flows obtain the bandwidth they need With it you often dont need additional classes However additional classes could be used if you really need a different set of SLA parametersFurther sometimes rather than providing something better you provide something worse for bandwidth hogging traffic So for example rather than placing your SQL DB into its own class you might place something like backup traffic into a scavenger like class with a minimal bandwidth allocation RVCE Hi what do u mean bro by the below  i dint get you specially Backup  you might place something like backup traffic into a scavenger like class  thanks RVCE BackupHost backups ie overthenet backups of user PCs and servers RVCE  RVCE Hi

OSPF Router LSAType 1 LSA,I am studying Router LSAType 1 LSA I know for different neighbors Type 1 LSA will give different InformationA Interface with no neighbors I have implemented with connecting R1 to a switch 1 When there is no neighbor R1 will send Hello but it would not receive a response to its Hello hence it terms this link as STUB network So my question is why it is termed as STUB network and for this STUB network it would give information as Link Id Networkhere in this scenario 19216830 and Link datasubnet maskhere in the scenario of the screenshot attached Link Data 2552552550 Why STUB network gives Network and subnet information B Interface with DRWhy this link is termed as TRANSIT And why it gives Link Id DR IP and Link DataInterface why it doesnt give network and subnet mask C Interface without DRHere it has 2 links one point to point and one STUB networkSTUB is to know network and subnet mask as there is no DR Why it gives totally different information and then needs STUB network it could have included in the point to point link description directlyPlease clarify for the above mentioned behavior for these 3 types of interface in Router LSAType 1 LSA I am attaching a sample topology with the router LSA outputThanks In advance Solved Go to Solution,Hi Ravi why it is termed as STUB network It is because as far as OSPF concerned this stub network is a dead end  packets can enter this network but they cannot get to any other network from there Remember  a stub network is a network in which the OSPF router has no neighbors so it can be reasonably assumed that there are no more routers so there is nothing behind that network The term stub is typically used in networking to denote a dead end property  you can reach the object with this property but there is nothing behind this object  you cannot proceed from that object to any other place Why STUB network gives Network and subnet information Keep in mind that the Type1 LSA or LSA1 always indicates a connection or a link of the originating router to an object in the network OSPF recognizes four types of such connections pointtopoint links to neighboring routers always pointing to the OSPF RID of the other neighbor transit links always pointing to the IP address of the DR in the transit network links to stub networks carrying the subnet addressnetmask information directly virtual links always pointing to the OSPF RID of the faraway router With a stub network in particular there is no other router in it to indicate a link to therefore the only option to describe a stub network is to state its network and netmask right away Why this link is termed as TRANSIT And why it gives Link Id DR IP and Link DataInterface why it doesnt give network and subnet mask Broadcast and nonbroadcast networks that contain two and more routers are considered transit networks because you can enter them through one router and exit them through any other router Packets may be just transiting these networks being passed from one router to another but their final destination may be elsewhere  hence the adjective transit The information about the transit networks address and netmask is contained in the Network LSA Type2 LSA or LSA2 which is originated by that networks DR Member routers of a transit network use their LSA1 to point to the DRs LSA2 and the LSA2 in turn contains the addressing information for this network and points back to individual member routers You can consider this to be a sort of optimization as the addressnetmask information about the transit network will be contained only in the single LSA2 as opposed to being repeated in each member routers LSA1 There are also other reasons for the existence of LSA1 and LSA2  more fundamental and more involved  but for our initial discussion it is safe to stay at this level Here it has 2 links one point to point and one STUB networkSTUB is to know network and subnet mask as there is no DR Why it gives totally different information and then needs STUB network it could have included in the point to point link description directly This is a specific property of OSPF that has proven to be quite confusing over time  indeed a pointtopoint connection to another OSPF router is described using two link entries in the routers LSA1 First a pointtopoint link to the neighboring router and a stub network entry describing the IP networknetmask used on this link The reason for this is the need to support unnumbered pointtopoint connections in OSPF An unnumbered pointtopoint connection would be described as a single pointtopoint link in each routers LSA1 pointing to the OSPF RID of the other router without any addressing information Consequently a numbered pointtopoint connection is essentially described as two entries A pointtopoint link to the neighboring router just like an unnumbered connection and a stub network entry describing the IP network on the pointtopoint connection

question Other question related to different topic regarding DR BDR election Suppose I have 3 routers in same multiaccesstransit network and all of them have priority 0 which would mean all 3 would not take part in the DR BDR election So what would happen in this scenario They would stop at 2Way stateIf they are in 2way how this would affect the topology and what would be the end result RVCE Hi Ravi My apologies for responding so late Suppose I have 3 routers in same multiaccesstransit network and all of them have priority 0 which would mean all 3 would not take part in the DR BDR election So what would happen in this scenario All three routers will remain in a mutual 2Way state None of the neighbors will form a full adjacency to any other router on this transit network As a result they will not synchronize their linkstate databases over this transit network and they all will treat the network as a stub network not leading anywhere In other words OSPF will behave as if the network never really interconnected the three routers together Feel welcome to ask further Best regardsPeter RVCE Thanks for the reply Could you please elaborate the process of DR BDR election in detail I dont understand the process of DR BDR election it confuses me For example If there are 2 routersR1R2 if I configure OSPF first on R2 then R2 becomes DR So what is the point of DR BDR election when it is like whichever router we configure OSPF first that becomes DRAlso i was reading BDR is elected firstwhy is that BDR is elected first I was reading OSPF from Routing TCPIP vol 1 and it says that After twoway communication has been established with one or more neighbors examine the Priority DR and BDR fields of each neighbors Hello List all routers eligible for election that is routers with priority greater than 0 and whose neighbor state is at least twoway all routers declaring themselves to be the DR their own interface address is in the DR field of the Hello packet and all routers declaring themselves to be the BDR their own interface address is in the BDR field of the Hello packet The calculating router will include itself on this list unless it is ineligibleSo my question is before the election here we see that some routers say they are DR and BDR What would happen if all the routers declare them as DR Also who becomes the calculating router RVCE Hi Ravito keep things simple and clear consider that when a router start to announce itself on a transit link thus broadcast or non broadcast network it initially tries to announce itself as DR There is a waittimer that stands by default to 40 seconds which is used by the new announcing DR to wait and listen if more recent DR where already present on the segment If the new router doesnt hear for any Ospf packet of a preceding DR then it elects itself as a DRThis is also why the adjacency formation last longer on transit links than on p2p links Therefore you may want also to account for this when you want speed up convergence on your domainTechnically this is a security mechanism to ensure that when a new router appears on a segment even though it has a higher priority or equal priority but higher addressing scheme that router cannot preempt an existing DR If this would happen you could end with two DRs on the same segment determining an inconsistency in the Ospf database In Ospf preemption of the DR may occur just in isolate and builted ad hoc config cases but in generally its not admitted by the protocolFor other protocols like ISIS for example which is link state protocol as well preemption of the DR is possible but you may have heard it called by a different name such as DIS RVCE Hi Peter Paluch Could you please elaborate more on this if possible I would like to know more about the reasons of existence of LSA1 and LSA2  which are more fundamental and more involvedThere are also other reasons for the existence of LSA1 and LSA2  more fundamental and more involved Thanks in advanceBest Regards Ravi

General Question on QoS,Hi everyone The QoS is my week point and I want to clarify ASP Here are some stupid questions that I want to answer from you as you are expert of Cisco and QOS magic 1 Is it compulsory to start marking voice traffic from IP Phone2 If IP phone is not marked traffic than how to access switch identify the traffic for marking3 If I am not configured QoS on Access switch but it is applied to Core switch and WAN router Is it beneficial for me Sorry in advance for these stupid questions RegardsDeepak Kumar,Hi Deepak First things first  Please do not apologize for asking and do not call your questions stupid These forums are here to answer exactly these types of questions I will try to answer your questions to the best of my knowledge but I sincerely hope that Joe Doherty also joins this thread and shares his view since I consider Joe to be an authority on this topic  sincerely 1 Is it compulsory to start marking voice traffic from IP Phone This depends on what your goals and needs are Without marking certain traffic differently it will not be treated differently in the network  it as simple as that If your network is overprovisioned with bandwidth and hardly has any congestion packet drops or excessive buffering marking the voice traffic is not going to make much difference because the queuing mechanisms that give preferential treatment to certain traffic classes wont kick into action anyway But if you do have choke points in network places where traffic starts to be queued potentially even being dropped due to congestion then marking the voice traffic is absolutely required to make it stand out Of course I did not emphasize it before since it seems to be so natural but it is likely good to call it out Your network must be configured to recognize different markings and to give them appropriate treatment Marking traffic by different DSCP values is not going to have any effect if the network itself ignores these markings 2 If IP phone is not marked traffic than how to access switch identify the traffic for marking There are not many options  switches typically have limited features to identify types of traffic One of the simplest approaches would be to be define a twostage policy using ACLs All traffic coming from the phones IP address and destined to a known TCPUDP port for signalling SIP SIPS SCTP would be recognized as signalling and assigned the DSCP value of AF41 for example All other traffic coming from the phones IP address would be treated as media and assigned the DSCP value of EF 3 If I am not configured QoS on Access switch but it is applied to Core switch and WAN router Is it beneficial for me This very much depends on where the congestion occurs If there is no congestion on the access layer then the QoS mechanisms would likely not do anything anyway There is a simple rule to remember though The moment you have a congestion even on a single network device and that device does not honor QoS markings you have essentially nullified your whole QoS policy since that device will treat all traffic in the same way and not treat the important flows preferentially exactly when they needed it the most Feel welcome to ask further Best regardsPeter RVCE its not compulsory to mark at the phone at all its just much simpler to do it this way in a cisco Uc deployment where your cucm basically tells the phone which dscp values to use for videovoice and signalling if you just tell your switch to trust these values than you do need to apply all sorts of acl on your routerswitch to define this sort of traffic Please remember to rate useful posts by clicking on the stars below RVCE 1 No its not as noted by Dennis2 It can be identified in various other ways As also noted by both Peter and Dennis3 As Peter describes it really depends whether theres congestion more specifically whether theres enough congestion that its adverse to the service needs of the applications and also whether QoS can provide the service levels required As you also specifically asked about a WAN router the foregoing still holds but its often one of the most common places youll see congestion going from a LAN to a WAN as often the latter supports less bandwidthBTW for number 1 marking traffic is really for efficiency It allow devices to quickly analyze a packets service requirements by examination of a single byte Again you dont need to mark packets to analyze them and further just because a packet is marked doesnt always mean it will be subject to analysis and given any different service treatment Also understand if packets are marked they might also be remarked along the wayAlso BTW when traffic ingresses a network QoS trust boundary already marked its often a good idea to somehow verify the marking is valid for the traffic

things that commonly could cause this result so I suggest that you check these things to see if one of them is the cause of this behavior does the 1841 have enough memory to run the 1511T code does the 1511T image really exist in flash and is the name spelled exactly correctlyIf the problem does not seem to be one of the above issues then I suggest that you establish a console session making sure that console logging is enabled and then boot the router Capture all of the console output during the boot process and post it There is probably some message in the output that will identify what the issue is with booting 1511THTHRick RVCE I agree with Richard In this situation you want to be really safeHave you tried running a verify on this ios imageRun the following command and post the results towards the endALso can you post the results from dir flashverify flashc1841advsecurityk9mz1511Tbin RVCE You can safely remove second boot command as I said as long as you have IOS on first place on flashthats the only requirementHTH Dragan HTH Dragan RVCE Dear  could you please help me resolve this problem Im using Cisco 819HG4GGK9 Router Due to Full disk we try to Format Secondary disk

Schimanovits from Cisco Support Community App RVCE No dont delete command which calls for image 124 You dont have this IOS on first place in flashYour configuration should work definitely I supppose that you saved config after adding boot command for IOS 15One thing should work for sure  from ROMMON mode using boot commandbut its manual work You can try with it and then after successfully booting on IOS 15 try to see if its going to work even after reloadmaybe then router is finally going to use boot commands as it shouldHTH Dragan HTH Dragan RVCE DisclaimerThe Author of this posting offers

Updating DMVPN encryption protocols,Hello I am looking for advice on updating our DMVPN hub and spoke routers with new encryption and hashing protocols Id like to update them to My main question is is there a way to automatically have the spokes renegotiate their tunnels using the new transform set and and ipsec profile that has been added The steps below are what I have so far If its not possible to have the spokes automatically switch over what would be the best way to update 20 DMVPN devices Is there anything else I should consider when making this change Thanks for any help Hub configuration Spoke configuration Solved Go to Solution,These are different clouds then modify one make sure its up and running and routing is ok then modify the primarily Down time will be very very short doing that way ThanksFrancescoPS Please dont forget to rate and select as validated answer if this answered your question RVCE Hi You cant remove the old profile and get the tunnel taking the new profile without configuring it You need by anyways to apply the new profile under the tunnel interface configuration Here you dont have a lot of solutions Do you have ssh access to all routes over the wan interface If so you can schedule a maintenance window and push all configs using a script If you have dynamic routing on all sites you can create a new dmvpn cloud new tunnel interfaces using the new profile When this new cloud is up and running you can shutdown old tunnels The impact will be less if all routing learned new ip addresses ThanksFrancescoPS Please dont forget to rate and select as validated answer if this answered your question RVCE Thank you for the suggestion setting up a new DMVPN cloud alongside the existing one seems to be the safest way to configure this We do have dynamic routing enabled between all sites using EIGRP This seems like a really interesting idea I guess there would be no problem setting up multiple DMVPN tunnels on single source interface We currently have a primary and secondary tunnel for most sites so this method would add two more Do you know if there would be any issue with conflicting configurations on the hub or spoke after adding a second DMVPN cloud RVCE Adding a new cloud which means network of is different from the other one you wont have any issues You already have 2 tunnels The second one you called backup how is it configured When Ill have your config for those secondary tunnel i will validate or not if you can do the following Depending on their config you can maybe leverage The second one as active with the new profile and when theyll be up you will change the first tunnel Can you share your tunnel config for hub and 1 spoke to see those 2 tunnels ThanksFrancescoPS Please dont forget to rate and select as validated answer if this answered your question RVCE Ahhh thats an excellent idea too Configs for our hub and spoke are below We have the primary tunnel going to our main datacenter and secondary going to out backup site We actually have two primary tunnels headed to our main datacenter most locations only use one tunnel locations with two ISPs use both I believe Spoke  crypto ipsec

ok then modify the primarily Down time will be very very short doing that way ThanksFrancescoPS Please dont forget to rate and select as validated answer if this answered your question RVCE Thanks for the suggestion Will be trying it out On another note would both DMVPN clouds share the same routes Im wondering how I could verify that the two clouds are the same in terms of routing RVCE Based on your config therere all part of EIGRP AS 1 If you issue show ip eigrp neighbor from HUB you can see the peering with spokes if you kept eigrp config as its basic config Or if you issue show ip route eigrp you should see Tunnel 10 subnets into RIB ThanksFrancescoPS Please dont forget to rate and select as validated answer if this answered your question RVCE Although on both ends of a DMVPN tunnel you should be able to rank which IPSec profile will be used first I recall an existing session will continue to use what its using until it has to start a new session Ie shutting the tunnel or clearing the crypto session would be required
